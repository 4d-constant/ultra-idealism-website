     <h1 style="font-size: 12px;">ACT of the "I"</h1>
      </div>
      <br/>
Being curious in knowledge, in search of the Cause of the World, we try to assume something more insignificant than emptiness, that is, <b>“Nothing”</b>. Assuming that before ‘all the diversity’ existing in the World (everything that now exists), and before a Certain Beginning – there is necessarily (is) <non-objective, inessential> ‘« »’, “which” we define as the cause as <b>“Nothing”</b>. This <b>Act of the “I” – as the “Act of Determining One’s Own Cause” activates the ‘First and Fundamental Condition of Being': the “Law of Harmony”</b>, that is the First necessary for the “I” Condition of the ‘Balance of Opposites'. Through the emerging factors of the <b>Total Scale</b> “Something” arises as an “Abstract passive Dot”, indicating to the “I” this initial (first and fundamental) relativity – <b>[ “Act of Determination” | “Nothing” ]</b>. <ins>It is unacceptable to take time into account at this moment</ins>. “I” shows “Interest in My Cause” (and/or the Cause of the World) at the current moment – this is “the Cause” that we, here and now, are exploring; 
<br/><br/>
<b>The first part of the Act is of colossal importance, since the “Abstraction ‘« »’ before the World” (“Nothing”), at the moment of touching the 'I' - arose and totally transformed:</b>
<br/><br/>
<h2 style="font-size: 12px;">The first part of the Act.</h2>
<br/>
<b>1.	1.	[ 'Act of Definition' (“Something”) | “Nothing” ] –> The status of “Nothing” has changed to the absolutely opposite – having transformed into “Consciousness”, as [“Nothing” –> “Everything”];</b>
<br/><br/>
Comment: Before the emergence of the World there is nothing, and even the current Mental touch of the “I” (<i>My or Yours, Any – current now</i>) of <b><ins>that moment</ins></b> causes a powerful Global reaction of the “Entity” and “Consciousness”;
<br/><br/>
<ins>This is happening right now</ins>. For thinking a process is needed, but here <b>Time has no meaning</b>. “Nothing” (the extremely categorical 'Nothing' of absolute scale) – ‘This’ is the <ins>most critical</ins> of all that is possible to imagine, just as the “Abstract passive Dot” is the most minimal of all that we are able to imagine. Such critical, extremely Total Ideas – the maximum and the minimum, are the Causal Beginning of All Beginnings, the Cause of the Being of Everything;
<br/><br/>
The categorical nature of "Nothing" was violated by the "Act of the "I"" <b><i>through Mental Touch</i></b>, which destroyed the Essence of "Nothing" - thus changing "Its" Status to the absolutely opposite. Any thought about "Nothing" leads to the emergence of "Consciousness", and with "Its" presence, this <b>"Act of the "I"" initiates the fact of "Firstoccurrence";</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>2.	2.	The status of the “Abstract passive Dot” was also violated and similarly changed to the opposite, [“Something” –> “Entity”] – transformed into a <ins>potentially Active</ins> “Entity” <i>(Relativity changed); </i>;</b>
<br/><br/>
Comment: the transformation of “Nothing” into the opposite “Consciousness” – changes relativity to the opposite, thereby transforming the ‘<ins>Abstract passive</ins> Dot’ into a “<ins>Concrete and <potentially active*> Entity</ins>”;
<br/><br/>
**potential activity of the Entity means the <b>presence of Will</b>;
<br/><br/>
This is how everything simple is so complicated, and vice versa – the most complicated, after awareness will become completely simple and understandable. On the other side of the question – there is your choice, that is, Agreement or Disagreement, coming through Logic + Conflict with all Stereotypes, and <em>through <ins>abilities, properties of your Reason</ins>, emotions, desire to live and develop, through admiration of Eternity and the Essence of the “Creator”, through ‘Love for Yourself, and for Your Own World’</em>;
<br/><br/>
<h2 style="font-size: 12px;">The second part of the Act.</h2>
<br/>
<b>3.	3.	In relativity [ “Entity” | “Consciousness” ], the Fact of the Presence of the “Entity” initiates a potentially infinite “Space” –> the “Entity” acquires a Global Status, that is, a “Global aspect of the Entity” (everywhere);</b>
<br/><br/>
Comment: Independent activity is manifested by means of Will – of course, by internal manifestation. “Consciousness” realizes the <i>‘Place of manifestation of Activity’</i>, which is interpreted as <ins>Space</ins>. The “Entity” is present without a specific definition and position, and has one <b>‘Global Status’ – ‘Is’</b>(meaning “True Existence”);
<br/><br/>
<b>4.	In relation to the Static “<ins>Global aspect of the Entity</ins>” –> in any space the opposite to It necessarily arises – the Active “<ins>Real aspect of the Global 'I'</ins>”;</b>
<br/><br/>
Comment: according to the already known to us ‘Law of Harmony’, even abstraction needs ‘concrete relativity’, in connection with which, the opposite of the ‘Global aspect of the Entity’ arises, namely the ‘Concrete state of the ‘I’ of the Global aspect of the Entity’, and here, we call it accordingly the <b>"Real aspect of the Global ‘I’"</b>;
<br/><br/>
<b>5.	Due to the Status of the “Global aspect of the Entity” (“He is everywhere”), an infinite number of 'His I' – “Real aspects of the Entity” – arise. In relation to the Active “Real aspect of the Global 'I' ”, they are defined as “Not I”;</b>
<br/><br/>
Comment: The specific position of the “Real aspect of the Global 'I' ” implies the Presence of the “Global aspect of the Entity” as a distributed “I Am”, that is, “Great Single 'I' in a potentially infinite number of “monads” – independently active aspects of the Great Single 'I'”, however, in the conditions of reality, at each point in space, for the Single <b>“Real aspect of the Global 'I'”</b> (that is, precisely from “His” face), each of the active “monads” is defined as “Not I” (in the opposite relationship, one can consider using one’s own example, how each of us, looking at another, becomes aware of one’s individuality);
<br/><br/>
<h2 style="font-size: 12px;">The third part of the Act.</h2>
<br/>
<b>6.	'Consciousness' realizes the Conditions of existence of infinite number of ‘Real aspects of the ‘I’’ in the form of concretization to forms of living beings. This Conditions include all static non-living things necessary for creation of various Situations for the purpose of analysis and extraction of experience, namely: Galaxies, Planets, atmospheres, subsoil, oceans, mountains, forests and deserts, and other environments - down to each "thing", taking into account the balance of the characteristics of living beings that can be active participants in situations;</b>
<br/><br/>
Comment: Each “Real aspect of the Entity” is, in essence (and in principle), abstract, that is, it is a kind of “Great Single 'I'”. By influencing the general “Consciousness”, each aspect becomes in fact “Real” only at the moment of “Presentation of Oneself” by some <specific> living being. <em>The Entity initiates a specific “I” by reading the wave of “Its” experience – thus influencing the “Consciousness”, which realizes an isolated space corresponding to the level of Reason and only for one specific being</em> – analyzing and extracting experience, exclusively subjectively, especially, and uniquely. The environment is <b>Ideas</b> (images), but the realization of each of them in isolated Worlds (Unicus) of individual beings is so different that it is never identical;
<br/><br/>
<b>7.	Realization of “Reason” by each Being –> and awareness of “Own Being” from the position of each “Real aspect of the 'I' ”, and Realization of personal bodily representation in the Conditions of Reality (‘Feast of Life’) – for the get of experience for the purpose of Development of the “Entity”;
<br/><br/>
The Fundamental Causes, in the last part of the Act, do not participate independently, that is through the "Law of Harmony". Each of all living beings, in the "Act of Self-Initiation and Self-Realization" is left "to Itself", which is another of the many means that increase the "Degree of Difference in experience";</b>
<br/><br/>
Comment: We have again encountered the fact that learning requires consistency and is a process and there is no other way of knowing. All stages of the Act of "I" arise instantly, as the "Foundation of Own Being" (Being of "I"), or even like this: the <strong>Act of "I" (directly) is the Foundation of Own Being (Being of "I").</strong> This is truly a "Phenomenon of Universal Scale", which we observe every day, as a process, and in telescopes - the "First Explosion and Expansion of the Universe" - this is the very process of reproducing the wave and realizing the conditions of reality.
<br/><br/>
Calculated and observed parameters, including the age from the moment of the "emergence of the Universe", all this is realized as Necessary Foundations, but - there is not, and was not, a "Beginning", and there is no End to this. The Eternity of the World, like the Infinity of the Universe, is also nothing more than a static wave function. But, let even this very proof remain a subjective decision on acceptance - personal matter for everyone. <i>Knowledge of the "Foundations of One's Own Being" is important, but, we understand - not for everyone</i>;
