     <br/><br/>
We consider it necessary to define ‘these’ (‘given’) relations:  
<br/><br/>
<b>1.</b>	[ Consciousness | Matter ]; <br/>
<b>2.</b>	[ Thinking | Being ]; <br/>
<b>3.</b>	[ Spirit | Nature ].  
<br/><br/>
<b>1.</b> This Task (<i>problem?</i>) not a consequence of our conclusions, we qualify it as ‘<b><em>Philosophical-Historical</em></b>’, but, as in solving other problems, we will approach the solution from the Ultra-Idealistic position (since we have no other). It is widely known (from ancient & classical philosophy), “Matter” is the smallest part of the material World - the Foundation, and the “<b><i>Smallest Detail</i></b>” of any <ins>extended</ins> (<em>material</em>) particle, and of <ins>each</ins> 'thing';
<br/><br/>
Modern science should be considered materialistic, and this is an intentional position of scientists due to the lack of data. It would seem that it is completely unimportant how to call the "Contemplated" and its Nature: of materialistic or idealistic, but what is important is the Essence of Interpretation and the Meaning of comparison in relation <strong>[ Consciousness | Matter ]</strong>, in judging about "OneSelf" and "Own Purpose": <strong>Who am ‘I’? What is the meaning of Life? What is My Role in the World?</strong>
<br/><br/>
"Consciousness" has an absolute dependence on the Entity, Its existence is actual only in the presence of a Alive Being. There is a most important Condition in this - Presence implies Reality, namely the realization of the "Reason" capable of analysis, extraction of experience and self-awareness of the specific "I", which this "Reason" belongs. From the opposite position - the "Entity" can be realized in the Conditions of Reality using Consciousness -> and Reason, for any subsequent conclusion (<i>full distinctness</i>).
<br/><br/>
In essence, it is necessary to consider ‘One without the Other’ with caution. <strong>[ Entity | Consciousness ]</strong> is a fundamental relation at the moment of ‘Firstoccurrence’ (i.e. the Cause of the World), but at the moment, solving this very <i>problem</i>, we consider the ‘Entity’ in the <em>‘Form Suitable for Contemplation’</em> – that is, in the Conditions of Reality. Matter, in this reasoning is implied as a certain <em>Inner Essence of the Mechanism of Contemplation</em>, namely: ‘Ephemeral Process of Illumination’ <an infinitely small detail, when dividing ‘Products of Consciousness’, that is, according to the <strong>‘Law of Realization of Foundations’</strong>. Based on ‘such a complex’ formulation, one can draw conclusion <ins>in which</ins> <em>Reason presents Consciousness as using ‘Matter’ as a material for the realization of ‘Reality’, however, this conclusion can be the result of analysis as an experience of infinite recursive division of the ‘Ephemeral Contemplated’ into constituent parts, here ‘Matter’ is meant – there is something elusive, infinitely striving for (non-existent) Sources</em>. Moreover, the smallest details (as example Electrons) of the objects under study will be <i>practically! identical</i>, which generally proves the <i>homogeneity of their composition</i> :), that is, we do not divide electrons into types: Electrons of Iodine, Electrons of Oxygen, and also protons will <ins>almost the same</ins>, but <b><ins>not identical</ins></b>, since <ins>identity is unacceptable</ins> (p. 199);
<br/><br/>
The main Essence of this reasoning is that <strong><ins>Matter</ins></strong> is no less ephemeral than Space and Objects. If it's possible to recognize <b><ins>This</ins></b> as something, then this, hitherto unknown, will be the <ins>next particle</ins> discovered by physicists – it'll always seem that it is the last one, but like <ins>all</ins> the previous ones, will be One of the First, that is, this Path is endless, and Matter, as such, does not exist, it is an Unattainable Goal of dividing the contemplated. <strong><em>The Law of Realization of Foundations will always realize the next object of a Brilliant (ingenious) discovery</em></strong>;
<br/><br/>
Most understand "Consciousness" as the "<em><ins>Functionality</ins> of the Our Brain</em>". After all, we will say: this is correct, but there is a request to focus attention, to concentrate on the fact that the brain of another person belongs to the category of the same <ins><b>"Contemplated"</b>, just regular ‘thing’</ins>, like any realized object;
<br/><br/>
If we look in the mirror, we see the head, <ins>implying</ins> its '<ins>internal Content</ins>'. Firstly, we do not see 'It' and secondly, the body is realized in accordance with its own idea in the conditions of reality, that is, “I” sees Itself as such in the ‘conditions of reality’ taking into account the existing experience contained in a specific (<i>readed by Him</i>) <ins>wave</ins>;
<br/><br/>
Exploring the mechanism of Contemplation, we realize the immersion inside the Self by forming the “Personal Wave”, gaining experience. At the same time, we are always in the center, representing the “I” (“Real aspect of the Entity”) in our role. Consciousness is presented outside, as through the eye we flying to inside, in the form of data of new experience (the data contains everything, including the body and its state), and the brain is implied to be contained inside the head, that is, it's associated with Consciousness in its past <usual> mundane representation. Although there is this very important subtlety: We do not see our own brain, but we do not deny that – with the current level of medicine, this extreme is probably feasible.
<br/><br/>
If this is so (<i>we can assume that it is so</i>), then the idea of “Consciousness” will correspond to how we imagine It, implying <i>some processor</i> [ '<em>program handler</em>' ], ‘figuratively consisting’ of “<ins>Consciousness</ins>” and “<ins>Reason</ins>”, but at the same time, we will not be able to distinguish One from the Other, understanding, however, that <em>‘“I” is there – in the center of “Consciousness”’. This would be an empirical, and precisely consistent study of the ‘stream that is never interrupted during life’, and outside the life process – is impossible;</em>; 
<br/><br/>
The position in this relation <strong>[ Consciousness | Matter ]</strong> is only <b><i>‘As for something obvious’</i></b> – <ins>this is how this task interpreted, without being particular Problem</ins>. We return to the discussion about the rooting of stereotypes, their tenacity in the judgment of many generations <ins>realizing the importance of having a Worldview</ins> (<i>they always wanted to have It</i>), some kind of one, but - certainly <ins>rational</ins>, which, as we believe, has a <ins>logically complete structure</ins> - this is the Main Thing for understanding the Conditions of Development, since <em>Intelligent Beings, in their general mass, strive for the effectiveness of any actions, are interested in preserving their species, and dream of a safe life in a Clear and Friendly Environment</em>; 
<br/><br/>
* * *
<br/><br/>
<b>2.</b> Relation <strong>[ Thinking | Being ]</strong>. What is Thinking? – the activity of the “Reason”. Being is existence, but precisely being alive, during the life process, in a broad sense these are also <ins>actions</ins> performed on the basis of logical conclusions, not excluding instinctive ones, one way or another – regulated by the activity of the “Reason”. That is, the relation is equivalent to comparison, in which:
<br/><br/>
<b>A.</b> The products of the activity of the "Reason" expressed as the Expression of Will of the "I" (<i>in the face of the "Concrete Personality"</i>), and forming, as a result of the analysis, the <b><i><ins>Vital Process</ins></i></b>, interpreted and realized as <b>"I" Am, "I" live</b>. We will not exclude the results of mental activity and the background of thought (<i>wandering of various thoughts</i>);
<br/><br/>
<b>B.</b> The conclusion about ‘Own Being’ and the result of this qualification, which is expressed: <b>“I” Am, “I” live</b>;
<br/><br/>
Therefore, in this regard – we are presented with the conclusion of René Descartes <strong><em>“I think, therefore I Am”</em></strong> and a <b><ins>similar comparison</ins></b>, where <b>[ Thinking = Being ]</b>;
<br/><br/>
<b>3.</b> We consider another relation <strong>[ Spirit | Nature ]</strong> – this is not where the proposed question <i><as you know></i> arose, with the intention of finding out the probable presence of interactions, influences, or at least touches (<em>and what was the Author thinking about?</em>).
<br/><br/>
<strong>Spirit (Phenomenon of Life)</strong> – the <ins>manifestation</ins> of the 'Global aspect of the Entity’ in relation to ‘Every Being in the World’, that is, ‘<ins>Endowment with the Property of Life</ins>’ through reading the Wave of the Personality by the “Real aspect of the Entity”;
<br/><br/>
<b>Nature</b><i> – is the Conditions of the habitat of Living Beings, <ins>corresponding</ins> to such ‘Characteristics of These Beings’, in relation to which these Conditions have significance.</i>;
<br/><br/>
So curious relation, but it really exists, the Role of the “Real aspect of the Entity” and “Nature”, as we have found in our research, is the correspondence “World for the Alives”, It <ins>necessarily arises</ins> at the moment of the Firstoccurrence;
<br/><br/>
<i>The emergence of habitats of an infinite number of living beings in their infinite diversity</i>, i.e. -> the Universe, Galaxies, Stars, Planets, landscape features of the environment: various, liquid, gaseous, emulsions, etc. Of course, we can complicate the concept of "Nature", but why? - it should implied exactly as we consider. <em>We often call the surrounding objects 'Nature', mentally leaning towards plants, animals, everything that moves, is dynamic, endowed with life, but we are <partly> mistaken in our judgments, because: <b>Intelligent Beings are endowed with the Most Important Role in the World, and are the 'Cause' - the Main Component of Nature, that is, We Ourselves, and specifically: <ins>You, Me, Everyone</ins></b></em>.
<br/><br/>
Therefore: <ins>We are not consumers, and not parasites</ins>, since Everything in <b>‘Our World’</b> arose at <b>‘<ins>Our Cause</ins>’</b>, and exists as an <strong><ins>Exploratory Environment for the Development of the Entity</ins></strong>;
