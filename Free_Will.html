<br/><br/>
<em>The Ultra-Idealistic model implies a complete and necessary interconnection of all events (determinism), from the Firstoccurrence to this abstractly current moment, in the flow of <Personal conscious activity>.</em>
<br/><br/>
This <b><ins>interrelation</ins></b> is realized in the <ins>process</ins>, that is, in the conditions of reality, through consistent research and <b>interest</b>, comprehending the content of the ‘Static Wave’, which is the indestructible <ins>Truth</ins>, and contains <ins>All Information</ins>; 
<br/><br/>
It should be explained that the <strong><ins>Structure of the World</ins></strong>, its content, all beings and situations are contained in the “Unified Wave”, from which we, in the conditions of reality, extract only the part available for research, and this concerns only our own experience, i.e. from what we know; 
<br/><br/>
<strong><em>The Wave does not contain the Future - only the Past;</em></strong>
<br/><br/>
<em>It is impossible to store or have: 
<br/><br/>
<b>1.</b> present (real) or <br/>
<b>2.</b> future, <ins>data</ins>(?) </em>: 
<br/><br/>
the first – cannot exist in principle - the situation dynamically forms the past from experience, and the second (<ins>absurd</ins>) cannot be <ins>data</ins> at all; 
<br/><br/>
<strong>[ "Known Future" ] and [ "Development" <i.e. "Life"> ]</strong> – are absolutely incompatible conditions. Knowledge of the future contradicts Development and the ‘Principle of Eternity’, which has corresponding grounds - <ins>for Eternal Being an infinite Path of Development is necessary, and the answer to the question</ins>:
<br/><br/>
<strong><em>–For what exactly do you need Eternity?</em></strong>
<br/><br/>
<em>The World is Eternal, Therefore – the Future does not exist in any form, neither in the wave, nor in the conditions of Reality</em>. One can try to predict it, or Prophesy on the basis of knowledge, but these attempts will not lead to a reliable Guarantee. 
<br/><br/>
<em>It is more pleasant to encounter ‘Surprise from ignorance’</em>, otherwise Humanity would not know wonderful discoveries. The Future is only an “<ins>expected</ins> something”, i.e. intentionally arising at the moment of transformation of the past into the real by means of new experience. The Real – at the moment of contemplation becomes the Past, i.e., the experience available. Then the same thing happens, by analogy – transformation in connection with the extraction of new experience. The Future is precisely formed, directly in the situation, however – always turns out to be nothing, empty and insignificant, and in detail examining:
<br/><br/>
<strong><em>“The Future is like an elusive ‘Edge of the New Reality’, which, when touched, turns into the Past”.</em></strong>
<br/><br/>
The essence of reasoning about the Future (and its inconsistency) lies in the necessity of requalifying the concept of Determinism into <strong><em>"Neodeterminism"</em></strong> (<ins>neo</ins>) - having no future and final phases, due to the Eternity of the World and Entity, and in connection with the fundamental and <ins>theoretical possibility of Eternal life</ins> (or <i>"very-very" long life</i>) subject to the observance or fulfillment of certain conditions. In addition, we assert the interdependence of everything - the absolute balance of forces and opposites, but the wave nature does not interfere with "<strong>Free Will</strong>", due to the "Structure of the World" necessarily containing the "<ins>Law of Harmony</ins>" controlling Its safety through the strictest observance of balance. That is, we are absolutely free in choosing actions and decisions - like God. This cancels <b><ins>All</ins></b> restrictions in Development, but through Religion and the Holy Scriptures - suggests that we observe the Commandments (... to preserve the perspective);
<br/><br/>
<strong>"Neodeterminism"</strong> (that is, Determinism, with the amendments of Ultra-Idealism) - in no way conflicts with Development, identical to "Free Will" and is determined in any of the known, significant, as it seems to us, and logical aspects: theological, cosmological, anthropological, and social - they are important to varying degrees, but not by Factors of Destiny, and not by chance or Luck is this principle ensured, but by the necessary "Law of Harmony" <strong>(the World is the Absolute Order)</strong>;
<br/><br/>
<ins>Any actions are aimed at Development</ins> and <em>formation of the future</em>, but precisely the supposed one. We believe that we are <i>‘able to be prudent’</i> and prepare conditions for the result we expect, but we cannot Guarantee Success and Quality. The reason is in the worldview, that is, in the environment of preparation of such conditions – which are not precise a priori (… and this is obvious), that is, they cannot be appropriate or suitable, because they cannot be created in the conditions of <i>‘ephemeral unstable reality’</i>. All components must be <b><ins>precise in the wave</ins></b>, that is, statically reliable, then the result will always be stable and absolutely precise, however, <ins>staticity is not available to us</ins>. We are not able to create a Standard, but there are no obstacles either. In addition, we have found out before that only Ideas of “things” can be precise, but in the conditions of reality “standards” are subject to the influence of conditions. <em>Identical objects, in the conditions of reality, in fact – do not exist, and cannot exist</em> (p. 156);
<br/><br/>
It follows that in order to be able to act more correctly and accurately, we need to overcome something that does not fit into our ideas. In other words: <strong>‘Free Will’</strong>, in principle, cannot have any limitations, but it does not have much meaning, as well as ambitions. <strong><em>‘The Essence of Free Will’</em></strong> in its pure form does not imply fears due to "Divine Supervision" - General Systemic Control, Purpose from Above, True Path, or anything similar. All This Is, but <b>the Essence is not in this</b>;
<br/><br/>
Some, lusting after “Free Will”, would like to rule the “World of People” without having the slightest reason (<em><b>every lazy</b> person who is thirsty for wealth does not want to study</em>). They mock the peasant's admiration for his freedom, 'as long as he (the fool) ploughs of his own free will' - hinting that when he gets tired of ploughing - he will guess that his previous Freedom was fictitious, and will become unhappy. By the way, they also have the prototype (template) of goals from the life cycle: 'I will earn money, and for the rest of my life I will lie on the sand and relax by the sea'. That is, the peasant will often turn out to be smarter than the pompous dandy, since reason does not depend on exquisite clothing;
<br/><br/>
<ins>Fatalism is impossible</ins>, because the <ins>Guarantees of the Eternity of the World are Absolute</ins> and cannot be threatened. This protection is provided at the ‘Systemic level’, it is a Fundamental part, and is integrated into the structure of the <b><i>“Single Wave”</i></b>. Sometimes, it is difficult for us to imagine something, since we are limited and are under the influence of very powerful stereotypes, but we are able to understand that in the “Endless routine of Universal events” – We Are – We Think. We exist – this the most reliable fact, of an absolutely reliable and impeccable Model of the World, which <acting now>, we are trying to find out, exploring It in practice, in constant fear – expressing doubts, <i>complaining about the absence of Free Will</i> :) due to the peculiarity of Determinism;
<br/><br/>
<ins>Conclusion</ins>: <ins><strong>Neodeterminism</strong></ins> (from the moment of the Firstoccurrence) and <b>Absolute Free Will</b>. <em>The actions of Beings in the World have no limitations – due to Development and <ins>similarity</ins> to God</em>. The World is not subject to danger, since it has a static foundation (the nature of a wave) and a Guarantee of protection through maintaining balance, i.e. the <b>"Law of Harmony"</b>;
<br/><br/>
It would seem "Decided", but no - now we need to think about the Meaning of "Free Will" as such. This is precisely fictitious paranoia. Let's assume that <br/><strong>God Himself is directing Us</strong>. 
<br/><em>…Shall we file a complaint against Him with the Police?</em><br/> 
What exactly do these or those answer options to this empty and useless question change? It is either this or Freedom. The question is probably offensive to many, to those who want it with all their Souls, because there is no better Teacher, it is even impossible to imagine. <strong>God is the Only One to whom you can unconditionally trust yourself, and in all senses;</strong>
<br/><br/>
It is need to focus your attention on the fact - <ins>we make many Willful decisions every day</ins>, throughout our life. And we do it consciously – understanding and accepting responsibility for our actions. For this simple reason, we can say that we are in the best conditions. <em>We have a desire and “intention to know” – once we more deeply Realize and “Essence of Freedom”</em>;
