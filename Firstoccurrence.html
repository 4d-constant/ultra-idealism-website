      </div>
      <br/>
Before discussing this topic, it is necessary to say that the “Firstoccurence”, or the Study of the Causes of the “I” and the Origin of the World – is an absurd exercise, due to the unconditional Eternity of the World (or, the Eternity of the Universe); From the position of each “Real aspect of the I”, the infinity of space is the fundamental importance – this does not allow one to doubt or make any conclusions other than – the World is Eternal. We know that space is not a suitable category for formulating postulates, since it is a “Product of Consciousness”, and is realized through the intention of the “I”, however, “Consciousness” Itself – fully corresponds to the statement about ‘Its Eternity’, because it has Eternal relativity. It is surprising that many people, including those in our audience, believe (…they believe in it): “Even the Eternal World has a Beginning and a Base (reason) for Existing” …however, not every one of the ‘curious’ manages :) to get to this line, but we are interested, and we will continue the study.  
<br/><br/>
The Cause of the World arises (and is) the basis of Its Own Being, immediately, at the very moment when You thought about it. The logic of the “Eternity of the World” is based on the fundament of Its ‘Functional Infinity’. On the other hand, sensually and psychically – ‘Man is in the conditions of the Process visible to him’, therefore he imagines all this in a corresponding way, that historically, and in fact, there is a certain sequence, in the process of which the Universe was formed. Of course, we are observing this process now. ‘The expansion of the Universe’ is a process connected precisely with the “Firstoccurence”, and nevertheless, no matter how it may seem to You – this Process has no actual “Beginning”, but it will be realized if you become interested in this topic and try to get to the bottom of the Truth. The facts of prehistory will always arise as a necessary basis. There will not end to this, and there was not ever Beginning. Consequently, the ‘Process of the World’s Origin’ may be relevant from the position of the ‘Real Aspect of the Entity’, and only in the case of His special interest… but, as a rule, Everyone is interested in this, which proves the deepest doubt, and ignorance of some ‘special’ Truths. The presence of the interest of  ‘I’, by the way, is confirmed by the ‘Search for the Foundations of One’s Own Being’ (it's no longer important);
<br/><br/>
<strong>The Global mental support of the "Entity"</strong> is clear and obvious, due to the consistently high interest in this topic and the desire for knowledge - an infinite number of living beings are looking for "Own Foundation", the moment of "Firstoccurence", and the "Cause of the World". This exists, and is happening at the moment, everywhere (and anywhere), or do we not understand at all what infinity is? Given the extremely high level of interest, and the super popularity of this "Eternal Topic", so, we begin research, enjoy this process: 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Nothing</strong> (<em>less than emptiness</em>) - is the absolute absence of being of everything, conceivable and inconceivable, in the fullest sense, non-objective, unnameable, and the absence of any conditions. It used as a forced concept that cannot be understood adequately, as well as correctly imagined (there is nothing to imagine). Nothing – as the primary causality ‘« »’ – cannot have a representation in the ‘Already Existing World’. Even emptiness can be considered as a certain <em>‘presence, by the fact of non-touching – that is, the smallest gap between the smallest particles’</em>, but ‘Nothing’ is not emptiness, since it cannot be something, even such as ‘Condition’, and Emptiness implies special ‘Condition’; <strong>We have defined and designated this ‘« »’, that is – ‘Nothing’;</strong> 
<br/><br/>
<strong>"Abstract passive Dot"</strong> - is the smallest of all that a person can imagine. However, this is not at all what we consider "the minimum point tending to infinity" (here there is absolutely no, and cannot be, any semantic, or any other, extension). "Abstract passive Dot" is identified with the abstract concept of "Something", as - "There is, but the most insignificant". Reasoning about "Firstoccurrence" we understand that this research is carried out from the position and in relation to "Properly I", that is, exclusively to "Myself" ('I Self') which is important. We recognize it and accept; 
<br/><br/>
<strong>The existence of the World - is a very weighty reason</strong>, a basis giving the right to reasoning, allowing us to assert about the ‘Firstoccurrence’. In this study, it is impossible to use specifics (for clear reasons), therefore, it remains possible to manipulate abstract concepts that do not have properties and sizes, except for indications of their absence: <strong>“Abstract passive Dot”</strong> (<ins>as</ins> “<b>Something</b>”), and “<b>Nothing</b>” = just 2 elements – this is a complete list of what we can operate with at this stage;
<br/><br/>
* * *
<br/><br/>
When we try to reason about <the Beginning Itself> ('Firstoccurrence'), we are not talking about the “First Explosion”, but about Its ‘Cause’, which (judging by the Laws obvious to us), must have grounds, that is, some “Beginnings” (main basic). Moreover, not one, but two, to create relativity, or we have to simply state the fact that: “We are not able, and are not capable of reasoning about this” (barrier). The essence is very simple - ‘Unrelative Being’ of anything is absolutely impossible. It is unshakable and rigid Law that gives us valuable Fundamental Knowledge: 
<br/><br/>
<b>the World arises through the Intention to Be and Have a Ground for Being*;</b>
<br/><br/>
*The essence of the simplest Worldview;
