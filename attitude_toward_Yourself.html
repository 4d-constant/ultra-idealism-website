     </div>
<br/>
<b>"The world is 'I'"</b> - is the most amazing conclusion, if it is made as an experience and has the necessary grounds. In any case, it is logical and correct, but it can be used to the fullest extent only if you have the Corresponding Knowledge. <em>Without grounds, it is just a joke;</em>; 
<br/><br/><b>
37. Jesus said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind”. <br/>
38. this is the first and greatest commandment; <br/>
39. the second is like it: “love your neighbor as yourself”. <br/>
40. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. (Matthew 22:37–40) 
<br/><br/></b>
Please note the content: <b><sup>39</sup></b> the second is similar to it: “love your neighbor as yourself” - it is important to understand that first you need to learn to love yourself, and then follow the example of “love your neighbor <b><ins>as</ins></b> yourself”. 
To follow the instructions given by Jesus Christ, it is necessary to “know yourself” in order to feel this Love and give it to people (and any alive beings); 
<br/><br/>
Here, a considerable part of your subjective attitude to this instruction (and to the Bible as a whole). You will have to interpret and understand it according to your own conviction. We believe that Self-Love must have grounds, be critical, but, in response to the question of any person: <em>-How can I love Myself if I have not achieved anything significant?</em> - we answer: <b><em>-Love Yourself only because You exist, but love God first, for You are a Part of Him.</em></b> 
<br/><br/>
This is not an instruction in response to a question, but a personal attitude to All Living Things in the World, but we will maintain a highly critical attitude to Ourselves - worthy of Our Love; 
<br/><br/>
In working on oneself, the results are not always important, but the fact of this work is most valuable, and even the intention, and the upcoming conclusion (with the intention already expressed) evokes Sincere Respect, because what is established is a deep self-analysis, and a recognition of Love for Oneself. Such care, defining the Path is rational development. Consequently, the level of education (not to be confused with the level of enlightenment) and culture, Conscience, Honor, Honesty, even Accuracy speaks of a special Love for Oneself;
<br/><br/>
Treat Yourself with Love, but moderately - do not make it humiliating for any other alive beings, because they (we) are all from God. <strong><em>Remember that the attitude towards Society is equivalent to the attitude towards Yourself</em></strong>;
<br/><br/>
<em>The phenomenon with the intention of "Give" does not mean - to give everything to those in need, while being left with nothing and becoming a beggar.</em> If this happens, analyze your own condition and its Cause - it will not be difficult to understand that you should not give up everything you have for free, thereby humiliating your Own Dignity, refusing Love for Yourself. Such an act can provoke censure in your address, not from the Face of God, but from the "I", i.e. from Yourself, and this may look not only like obvious poverty and ascetic discomfort, but more serious ailments;
<br/><br/>
<em>A reasonable "Intention to Give" is realized not only through charity, but through satisfying needs, using the method of exchanging produced goods for others, equal to them, produced by those who need yours</em>; In the modern World, this is done quite simply, through the use of universal means of exchange (...money);
<br/><br/>
Of no small importance is cleanliness, attitude towards one’s own body, its culture, posture, as well as gestures that connect emotions and actions (<i>i.e. manner of behavior</i>);
<br/><br/>
Love Yourself wisely. Observe the attitude of other people towards You – this is the indicator that You Are in Harmony with the “Global aspect of the Entity”;
