     <h1 style="font-size: 12px;">THE REAL ASPECT OF THE GLOBAL 'I'</h1>
     </div>
     <br/>
Try to recall that which arises as the <b><i>Foundation of Being “I”</i></b> – consistently and with interest exploring and analyzing 'It' in the conditions of Reality (<strong>Γνῶθι σεαυτόν, “Know Thyself”</strong>). <i>We repeat now the 'Firstoccurrence', in some different words:</i>
<br/><br/>
<b>1.</b>Conclusion about Own Being, by means of R. Descartes' method "I think, therefore I am" - as activation of Interest in the 'Fact and Conditions' of own Being, first of all (Reality is extension and sequence), from parents, great-great-great ... grandmothers, great-great-great ... grandfathers, and further to ancestors in all generations, to reach prehistoric ancestors and also their foundations, going back to the Causes of the World (... in the end we will continue), that is, 'timeless, but direct factual connection' <b>[ the obvious presence of the World, and | the search for the Causes of Its emergence ] ("Firstoccurrence")</b>. Each seeker has the right to choose the method that he recognizes as correct, <ins>but</ins> it is much better to stop at a more <i>reasonable and rational one</i>. And, if you ask:
<br/><br/><em>
–Why should we delve into the conditions of our own Being?
<br/><br/></em>
the answer will be:
<br/><br/>
–To choose the Right Purposes (corresponding to the Purposes of the "Entity"), to build your life rationally, to develop effectively, and to live long, if possible always. This is only for those who are interested in Development;
<br/><br/>
For our reasoning, we will take into account not only the current model, but also the materialistic world order. So, let's assume that before the emergence of the first particles, nothing existed at all. Or, if we admit that there was "something" from which everything began ('Matter is uncreated, eternal, ... and infinite') - then a number of questions will arise, starting with: 
<br/><br/>
Where did this "something" come from?, and then we will again return to the question "What was before the very first (matter), the smallest particle?" If we are stuck with this question, and we have no Ideas, then let's try to understand - How can something, namely material, physical, be formed through "Nothing"? Answer: It's impossible. Therefore, it is necessary to admit that everything arose, and not through some <i>"Chaos and Broth"</i>. But, the World successfully exists, which means that it arose in a completely different way, and that this way is logical - this is 100%, and precisely "obvious" :). It may seem rather daring (so sorry), but a fact is a fact; 
<br/><br/>
<b>2.</b> Before the emergence of anything, there was nothing in the absolute and the full sense, but need to add: there was nothing, conceivable and inconceivable (<b><i>by us, and anyone else</i></b>). We will define It as <strong><ins>"Nothing"</ins></strong> - i.e. less-than-emptiness, namely, that which is impossible to conceive in the existing World and especially in the conditions of reality. We are not able to adequately imagine it - let's take this into account as a kind of bonus, <em>"strengthening to a lesser degree, the our position"</em> of which we are capable - in the representation of the insignificance of "Nothing";
<br/><br/>
<b>3.</b> Next, we need to understand the Absence of Conditions, i.e. space, like Time, is not appropriate to mention in the Situation being studied, and has no meaning (!). This does not exist, as well as what we understand as extension, there is nothing, and there are no conditions. But, in relation to the Fact Being Studied Here, two “things” have arisen in “Consciousness”:
<br/><br/>
a). <b><ins>Interest in the Foundations of Own Being</ins></b>, including the analysis of Previous Conditions – exp. & knowledge, all that leads to a specific Personality (‘I’);
<br/><br/>
b). <b><ins>Definition of "Nothing"</ins></b>, the purer and more insignificant to imagine – the more effective <b>“<ins>It</ins>”</b> is.
<br/><br/>
<b>4.</b> In connection with the initiative shown to this Question, the Law of Harmony and the dependent Law of Realization of Grounds arise - these are imperceptible <em>Neutral <b><ins>Forces</ins></b> of Order</em> (intention is a border phase between desire and action, but implies the ‘inevitability of action’), in the conditions of reality they are represented, for example, as “Neutrons”, or rather their internal neutral balance. Neutral potential can be represented comprehensively, associatively and collectively, as: the center of the foundation; support for creating balance; the essence of relativity; the border point “zero”. 
<br/><br/>
The creation of an imbalance in any aspect, in any environment, or in nature as a whole, causes the need to eliminate the violations that have arisen, and leads to Active Dynamics (if we talk about the nature of the wave, then everything simply arises, and when studied, it is realized consistently, of course, procedurally in the usual conditions of reality: time, space, extension, objects, relativity);
<br/><br/>
<b>5.</b> So – <b>by Cause of the Interest + and the Definition of “Nothing”</b>, there arises a Point of relativity, that is, an <b>“Abstract passive Dot”</b>, as a minimal “<ins>Something</ins>” from what we are able to imagine. The actual “<ins>Something</ins>” as a relativity to “<ins>Nothing</ins>”. The Great Event, and the Beginning. The Condition and the Essence – in the Absence of Time. <i><b><ins>Just need</ins></b> to realize the Connection between: Your Interest and the moment of the ‘Firstoccurrence, and the Origin of the World’;</i>;
<br/><br/>
<b>6. "<ins>Nothing</ins>"</b> <ins>loses its previous Status</ins> - given the extreme specificity, changes its Status to the <<ins>absolutely</ins>> opposite - transforming into <b>"Consciousness"</b>. That is, literally, From <b>"Nothing" -> into "Absolutely Everything" <<ins>potentially</ins>></b>. <i>We understand this as the simplest wave function, but for its realization (consideration, study) we would need an infinitely long time, but practice shows that a person realizes a very small part;</i>;
<br/><br/>
<b>7.</b> The status of "Something" (i.e. <b>"Abstract passive Dot"</b>) also changes to the <<ins>absolutely</ins>> opposite, transforming into "Entity". <b>From ("Something") "Dot" to -> "Entity".</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>[ Nothing | Something ] –> [ Consciousness | Entity ]</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>8.</b> Due to the arisen, <i>‘changed relativity’</i> (<b>[ «Consciousness» | «Entity» ]</b>, taking into account the presence of extension functions), the «Entity» acquires a new Status «Global aspect of the Entity», <ins>this requires balance</ins> and the emergence of the <b>‘Real aspect of the Global Entity’</b>, the alive «Real aspect of the Global 'I' ». For this Reason, <b>Space</b> is <ins>necessarily realized</ins> and the Act of discovering an infinite number of points where <b>«I Am Not Here»</b> occurs, with the simultaneous emergence of an infinite number of alive «I», i.e. similar «Real aspects of the Entity» from the position of the <strong>«Real aspect of the Global 'I'»</strong> defined as <b>«Not I»</b>. It is also possible to consider the emergence of the «Real aspects of the Entity» as the background of the relativity of the «Real aspect of the Global ‘I’» to the «Global aspect of the Entity», there is no mistake - since everything is interconnected. All arises at one moment;
<br/><br/>
<b>9.</b> The Entity initiates the necessity of creating conditions for an infinite number of living beings of the "Real aspects of the Entity", accordingly taking into account their properties and infinite diversity. "Consciousness" realizes everything that is required, the Universe, Galaxies, Planets, the necessary nature, environment, prudently for each species;
<br/><br/>
<b>10.</b> <em><strong>"The Three Hypostases of Entity"</strong></em> arise in one moment and are the fundamental Cause - Basis of the World. We consider Them taking into account Faith from the Position of Religions:
<br/><br/>
<b>I. God the Father – “The Global Aspect of the Entity”. (One Global "I")</b> Everywhere at the <em>same time (out of time)</em> <Inaccessible. Unthinkable. Incomprehensible>. Directly* endows every alive being with the Life Spark – providing an infinitely small part of the Own “I” (not by desire, but by Its Nature);
<br/><br/>
<b>II. God the Son – “The Real Aspect of the Global 'I'”.</b> <em>Representation of "God the Father" in the conditions of reality</em>. "<ins>Alive Being</ins>" of any form (which He Himself chooses in the conditions of a specific reality). He has no limitations. In what number of Persons is He realized? - This is unknown (possible in any). Has all the possibilities and data - the entire stock of experience of the world (<em>"The ways of the Lord are inscrutable", and incomprehensible</em>);
<br/><br/>
<b>III. God the Spirit – “The Real Aspect of the Entity”.</b> The '<b>Spark of Life</b>' - the “I” of every alive being in the World, or, in All Worlds, …if there are infinitely many in the Universe (or All Universes if exists );
<br/><br/>
<b><i>"The Three Hypostases of Entity" are "<ins>Systemic</ins>", <ins>fundamental</ins> – inseparable from the World – They arise simultaneously and are the Cause of Everything;</i></b>
<br/><br/>
<b>What is Life?</b> – By researching we come to three aspects, reflecting the three Hypostases of the Entity, from different positions:
<br/><br/>
1.	<b><ins>Spark of Life</ins></b>. Light, - phenomenon of seeing, contemplating. Intention to be. Abilities: to love, to sense, to feel, to have Reason and to think (including the subconscious <b><i>Condition “I Am!”</i></b>). We also include individuality in this aspect, that is, the ability to Improve Yourself, to improve the design through subjective conclusions, and the formation of the corresponding functions of the unique Reason (and mind). With Life, we also receive primary protection, that is, basic reflexes and instincts. Everything that is provided from Above. <b>(<ins>SPIRIT</ins>)</b>;
<br/><br/>
2.	<b><ins>Interest</ins></b> - and Rational, effective Development, Intuition. The Path to Perfection through the implementation of the corresponding foundations. <b>‘Eternal Search’</b> of all variants of experience – leading the <b><i>Primitive</i></b>* –> to <b><ins>God</ins></b> – acting in the conditions of Reality, consciously, through setting <ins>Global Purposes with the Foundation of Eternity</ins>, with Care, the Intention to “Give”. Namely, deeply conscious actions, Happiness, studying the Essence of “things”, discoveries, knowledge of Truths. <b>(<ins>SON</ins>)</b>;
<br/><br/>
3.	<b><ins>Being</ins></b> - in the <ins>usual</ins> sense. Amazing Morning. Productive Day. Wonderful Evening. Ordinary, life process. <ins>Love. Children. Family. Work. Illness. Death</ins>. Emotions. In the minds of the most ordinary person – this is grief and tears, and of course joy and fun, rest, play, holiday. <b>(<ins>FATHER</ins>)</b>;
<br/><br/>
<i>*Primitive, here, means the primary state of any creature. It can be understood as: an embryo, a carrier of the code (DNA), a fertilizing cell, a fetus, or a newborn (anyone), in a pre-experienced state;</i>
