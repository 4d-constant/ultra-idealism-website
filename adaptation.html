     <h1 style="font-size: 12px; margin-top: 5px;">ADAPTATION<sup>***</sup></h1><!-- Adaptation with reorganized Reason with New 4D-5D Functions -->
     </div>
<i  style="margin-left: 214px;">… the first condition of worldview</i> 
<br/><br/>
For successful adaptation to extremely unusual conditions, meaning four- and five-dimensionality, and the oddities associated with this <let's say> - one should at first abandon Academic knowledge (forget everything in general), plunge into the pure, literally 'Primordial Idea', but the "Moment of Firstoccurrence", however, requires exactly this, for clarity of presentation, and full awareness. We, together with you, will follow this Path – with a sincere desire to do everything possible for your understanding, or at least try to contribute to this. There are many reasons, here is your future intention to <b><ins>Give</ins></b> (<em>because you are real researchers, developers: physicists, mathematicians, geneticists, biologists, and neurobiologists, astrophysicists, and specialists in the field of ‘IT’</em>), and the study of important details at the moment of the Origin of the World, because it is known that you will always be interested in this amazing topic for reflection, which is very positive;
<br/><br/>
On the other hand, we should not delve too deeply, so that this knowledge does not acquire the <i>Standard form</i>, but allow your own thought to <i>Fly Freely</i>. Thus, we’ll lightly touch on many questions, in aspects where it seems to us that they correlate with the (previously hidden) features of Our World, studied here. Let us discuss the <ins>potentially</ins> realizable dimensions, the five-dimensional space (as example), used in the realization of the "<em>Collective Synchronous Reality</em>". When we extracting subjective experience, there is no particular need for five-dimensionality, except for the analysis of its geometric representation. Just like three-dimensional space, we do not use it during sleep, if sleep without dreams is not realized. If someone sees a body during sleep, it is <em>“an object in someone else’s space + the conditions that correspond to it”</em>. 
But, it is not rational to reason <i>‘about your body during your sleep, from the position of an outside observer’</i>, since this assumption will not become a fact, and such mistakes should not be made. Reasoning about some sleeping body is relevant, but assuming the presence of an audience through the prism of one’s own relations, and taking these conditions into account; 
<br/><br/>
The degree of dimensionality, as we well know, belongs to space as an attribute and is realized as a certain condition of integration for the arrangement of <ins>objects</ins> of the corresponding dimension. If somewhere there exist "inanimate objects" of a multidimensional nature, then <following the example of a sleeping body, or any other ordinary object> conditions are necessary for these "objects", as are such conditions, for example, for a piece of ice that was <i>forgotten</i> on the floor in an empty deserted room - according to the conditions, all the ice will melt, after which a puddle of water will remain <i><...which will dry up over time></i>. If someone enters the room, then according to these conditions there should be a puddle there – there will be one. A similar Idea is in the discussions of multidimensional objects and the conditions that belong to them. We may not see multidimensional beings, but <<strong>World for the Living</strong>> we will probably be able to detect their "traces", the consequences of their activity. They will not hide them, just as 'we do not cover our tracks in the sand' and do not try to hide our life activity 'from others'. Of course, we understand that <strong>"Everything is a wave"</strong>, and not that <i>"the wave exists only when we do not see specific objects"</i>, <b>but <ins>No</ins> - 'the wave is always there'</b>, even when we see objects and participate in situations. At the moment of contemplation - we read the wave, but when we do not see anything ("sleep soundly without dreams"), we do not read - then there is no reality, no situations. But in any case, there will remain conditions that will apply to objects when we wake up, i.e. in the presence of the "Entity" (us) this will become relevant; 
<br/><br/>
It is not easy to adjust even a Reorganized Reason so that it takes into account the Main Condition – the Contemplated is an <i>ephemeral illumination</i> in a dedicated part of the <i>Consciousness</i>(?), i.e. situations and objects located in the space realized for each “Real aspect of the Entity”. For those who study deeply: it is necessary to understand that everything is ephemeral – the realized, the mental, and the space; and the wave too, or rather <i>‘<ins>its visualization</ins>’</i> – if you try to imagine it; 
<br/><br/>
Throughout the content of these studies, we once again demonstrate the intention to summarize the complete absence of anything external, existing outside <b><our></b> “<ins>Consciousness</ins>”, but we have reliably found out that This is a <i>Unified System (“<ins>Consciousness</ins>”)</i> - <b>common and ours</b>, here it is implied unambiguously, that is, exactly the same.
<br/><br/>
It follows from this that <strong>‘dimensions are thought forms that organize a more qualitative environment’</strong> for the <i>process of ‘Entity Development’</i>. This complicates the process of understanding the structure, but – the understanding itself becomes possible, which equally simplifies knowledge about it, makes it inseparable and logical (<ins>suitable for reasoning</ins>);
<br/><br/>
Considering the Significance of Development for the Entity, this statement will follow: the realization of dimensions has no limits, this confirms some <em>‘reasoning in the consequences’ of the 'Firstoccurrence', about the infinite number of dimensions</em>;
<br/><br/>
<strong>Multidimensionality</strong> – by this concept we mean an abstract construction of an infinite degree of dimensionality – potentially including any spaces, according to the principle of integrating subordinate spaces into all those exceeding them in the degree of dimensionality – maternal spaces. Geometrically, no one (except God), can imagine Multidimensionality, that is, Be the Cause of the realization of Space of an infinite degree of dimensionality, but separately we can try to express Multidimensionality for one – directly subordinate dimensionality of degree ∞ -1 (<i>minus</i> 1):

<p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 55px; font-weight: bold;">Q<sup>∞</sup>  <–  { ∞ x [ Q<sup>∞</sup> - 1 ] }</p>
(Q-space of any dimension is expressed similarly)
<br/><br/>
Multidimensionality is theoretically the Whole World (in the relevant aspects), provided that it is simultaneously synchronously realized in reality by living beings, representatives of each dimension, but necessarily simultaneously, with the participation of God Himself, and in the contemplation of a specific object, by all participants (too many, literally - "unthinkable conditions" :). We assume: simultaneous contemplation by all beings of the Universal Central Black Hole (if such exists);
<br/><br/>
* * *
<br/><br/>
Based on all the content, I would like to focus on the importance of other mechanisms of realization: vibration (feelings), smell (smells), touch (sensations), hearing (sounds). In addition, pay attention to importance of semantic content: everyday speech, the <ins>content of books and films</ins> – <i>we'll most likely <b>have to face</b> all these events sometime in <ins>Real Life</ins></i>.
<br/><br/> 
That is, we are quite capable of realize this, down to the faces and words spoken, but - with a subjective improvisation of meaning, with much more exciting and interesting plots, because it is realized by you yourself, in <b><i>Your own World</i></b> <i.e. individually and subjectively>. This does not mean at all that ‘we use ready-made plots and scenarios’ – those who claim this mean some kind of “Information Belt”, or “data reserve and storage” – which contains absolutely all information and it is impossible to come up with anything new, some even refer to God and His creative activity, etc.
<br/><br/>
<strong><em>"The General Bank of Information"</em></strong>, он безусловно существует, как <em>'alive but static wave'</em>* in "Consciousness". Trying to reflect on any specific topic, analyzing thought forms, flows of spontaneously processed data, in search of related ideas and patterns, it becomes clear that there are associative connections in the <strong><em>"Bank of Information"</em></strong>. This is intuitively felt to be systemic, but has an abstract construction. It should be noted that the data contained have, territorially (<i>but, in a global sense</i>) different origins, since New discoveries can be Earthly, and then they are 'discovered simultaneously by' several people (<ins>usually two</ins>), but more often discoveries are made and not published for 20-40 years, and apart from them (these authors) no one can discover them. This means that Ideas may not be human at all, and can be invented by those who generate them right here, on Earth and independently. It is interesting that this "System" does not care about language, since this is <em>the Universal Language of Pure Concepts, but do not distanced or alienated – all this is here and now;</em>;
<br/><br/>
*‘alive but static wave’ – it seems paradoxical, but, it is precisely <em>static, and is dynamically supplemented in the flow of events</em>, which is caused by the Active Development of the Entity, i.e. an infinite number of “Real Aspects” participating in different Situations;
<br/><br/>
We understand <b><paradox></b> the Essence of Infinity ‘<i>in theory – throughout Eternity, Everything can be thought of has been invented</i>’, or rather, it could have been so, but – it is reliably <b><ins>not so</ins></b>, for the following reasons, and according to all laws:
<br/><br/>
<b>1.</b> Cyclic Function of Eternal Expansion of the Life Area – <ins>the World is infinitely expanding</ins>. Therefore ‘It is impossible to invent everything’, and There is no limit to our Development; <br/>
<b>2.</b> Completeness contradicts the presence of the World and – it hinders the ‘Development of the Entity’ (the Meaning of Life); <br/>
<b>3.</b> + Synthesis is a process of endless transformation.. 
<br/><br/>
It turned out that this is so, the <b><i>Amazing Paradox</i></b> asserts the <em>"Rationality of the Eternal System"</em>, and forms the "Essence of the System of Development of the Entity". It is impossible to live Eternally (infinitely) having a limit in Development. This, in itself, is <ins>proof of the <b>impossibility</b> of the fact</ins> that we <i>"use already existing, ready-made information"</i>, and are not able to create something <b>"really new"</b> (Yes. We can.);
<br/><br/>
In addition, it should be noted that there is an infinite number of alive beings 'Real aspects of the Entity' - <ins>uniquely emerged</ins>, each of which has its own individual World (Unicus), has a subjectively organized Reason, with Unique Functions. At the same time, it is necessary to take into account the Unique structure of the <Universe - suddenly there will be many of them>, and each Galaxy, Planet, and + their unique Nature.
<br/><br/>
All this, taken together, tells us that at the moment of the Firstoccurrence, Someone or Something tried to be extremely prudent in order <b><ins>not to allow identity</ins></b>, since the assumption threatens the tendency, and therefore the World as a whole. Is it possible to assert the "<em>Fact of Uniqueness of each electron in the Universe</em>"? - Yes. And also that the Components of the Contemplated Illumination are not factual - are realized as the Psychic phenomenon and Functions, in the <b>content of wave</b>;
<br/><br/>
* * *<em style="margin-left: 225px; color: blue;">“To think - is to Сreate!”</em>
<br/><br/>
What if the Sun, and everything that we understand as "Emitter" and looks to us as "Emitters of photons and other particles" - it's "Consciousness" or "Its" functional part (organ) - looks like this! strange (as it looks now), or it seems strange to us, because <it is difficult to wrap your head around>, ...and this is logical to some extent. What do we mean by this? - For a better understanding, we suggest considering not parts of the "Emitter", but something completely different. Some 'thing', or something more, for example, the Ocean (it is truly beautiful) - for us it is water in which you can swim, in the ocean we fish, travel, have fun, etc. We value Him for reasons known and familiar to us, but let us suppose, remember about our not-quite-adequate judgment, and try to discern in the Ocean some 'Essence of the Development of the Entity'. First, we must look at Him as a means of safety, that is, liquid on a rotating body (Planet), in such quantity - this is a balance of centrifugal force, that is, a certain rotation damper, which is realized by Consciousness as one of the foundations of our safety (But, it is for us, for the Alives, and that we must 'put this at the forefront' first of all, in any reasoning). 
<br/><br/>
The Ocean may also be one of the Worlds, but for other creatures. But, there are already several Worlds located there, there are even some that can only be seen under a microscope. Yes, they are also three-dimensional, but we cannot deny that there are five-dimensional water creatures, and - if we can assume (‘think’) about this, then the Essence already uses it somewhere (there are no boundaries and no limits) - the World, from any position (except the Essence Itself), is perfect, has no limits, in any aspect, all this provides a <strong>“loop(.)” of Infinity</strong>;
<br/><br/>
- - -
<br/><br/>
We also affirm the Absolute Uniqueness of every living being - capable of creating New Unique, From a <seemingly> Simple Idea, to a Global Law. The point is that we do not download scripts of works, feature films and other Ideas from the Intergalactic Network. <strong>We Ourselves are capable of Generate and Creating</strong>, and everything created by us - acquires associative connections;  
<br/><br/>
These principles are significantly different from <b><i>‘Physical Systems’</i></b>, which seek to repeatedly use carefully tested (the same) technology, to achieve reliability, but the material is dynamic due to the ‘<em>temporary ephemeral nature</em>’, since in reality it cannot be otherwise, however – we use drawings, prototypes, different standards, there is something good in this from the ‘Entity’ – <i>only the desire for Development</i>. Probably, even this should be recognized as progress, but the overwhelming majority of humanity (99.99%) really consider the World external, existing outside of ‘Consciousness’. The remaining 0.01% imagine the World independent of ‘Consciousness’ and external – but they recognize the ‘Soul’ as ideal, others think that the World is Love, others also know that the World is a thought – a living or virtual matrix;
<br/><br/>
This is the main reason for the presentation in such a format – without using terms, on the other hand, <some> Academic concepts can disrupt the intent of this research. We prefer to allow confusion (which, if desired, the reader will have to understand) than a complete misunderstanding. In addition, we are categorically against the generally accepted principle (‘<i>Law</i>’) of citing references to existing sources: Which of the <i>Great said?, …or, Which of the Fathers asked the question?</i> <b>But, what to do – if this is New?</b> <b><ins>Conflict</ins></b>, <i>…should we focus on the one who got lost?</i>
<br/><br/>
<em>By avoiding comments and references to texts of respected scientists, we refuse to mislead our audience, due to our subjective interpretation of the Great Ideas. The exceptions are: René Descartes and his Masterpiece and Eternal – ‘The Act of Self-Confidence of the “I”’ (Discourse on the Method, 1637, 'Cogito Ergo Sum'), and Immanuel Kant and his ‘things-in-themselves’ (Critique of Pure Reason, 1781);
