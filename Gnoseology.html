     </div>
<br/>
Let us discuss the <i>natural relation</i> <strong>[ Subject | Object ]</strong>, i.e. we propose to repeat, and perhaps even specify some details. From a certain position*, as before, we have no need to ‘assume objects to be external’ (existing independently of ‘Consciousness’). The Eternal World exists in the format of a wave. In principle, it is a dynamically changing volume of data, like a file, but it is not in a physical storage, exposing all data to danger (then everything would lose its meaning), but is in dynamic, that is, it Is in use by each ‘Real aspect of the Entity’ (‘I’) and the general Unified ‘Consciousness’, respectively. <em>Remember the processor cache memory – it is invented according to this Idea, as everything else has an indirect, but Some Relation to the “Entity”</em>. This wave consists of parts, each of them is always changing, being refined and developed. Each part corresponds to and relates to some ‘<ins>Thing</ins>’: Law, Idea, being, object, thought, situation, principle, representation, and each particle. ‘Wave Volume’ is virtual and infinite. <em>It is static, but dynamically developing together with the World and the Entity</em>. This phenomenon is perceived paradoxically, strangely, as it is characteristic of the <strong>“Nature of the Two-Aspect Entity”</strong>; 
<br/><br/>
The roots of Gnoseology are closely intertwined with Metaphysics, like everything in this world, but diving into the vanity of vanities we refuse to understand the Trifles <which are not at all>. Let's consider the example of the things we use. They were not like that, everyone knows that. For example, a fork is not its final form, and previously it was not like it is now. It was a thin sharp stick, then a forked stick of a smaller size, then an even smaller one, with three sharp ends.
<br/><br/>
By studying the development and change of any objects, one can draw a conclusion about their rational development, or the desire for a more effective form (<i>substance</i>). But, following the example of the "fork" (this is quite sufficient) - <strong>each object either <ins>develops or disappears</ins> ...</strong> this is practically true, since its wave is not used, due to its irrelevance. <em>Note: "drags" are almost never used, and are not relevant, they are "forgotten" since the wheel was invented</em>;
<br/><br/>
Each object ('<b><ins>thing</ins></b>') is a '<em>Mentally active stimulant (incentive) of the Reason</em>' and is perceived as an extension, like a sound or vibration, reading a photon wave stretches any object, inwards, and if we reason about this from a static position, then the object, step by step, as we interpret it and then analyze it - is divided into several frames in four-dimensional space, but we know that there are no frames, there is only a constantly flowing inward <ins>data stream</ins> (<em>frames are necessary for us in the matter of analysis, i.e. mental representation of the situation</em>);
<br/><br/>
An object, as an irritant of Reason, is qualified by that "thing" which, in a specific situation, corresponds to it most accurately. It would seem that any object, even a particularly unexpected one - like a Meteorite from a distant Galaxy, can accidentally appear at the point of attention, but there are no accidents, and we see the situation that has developed for us in a natural way. Here we must understand that we will not necessarily receive experience, however - it can be extracted, which depends on the ability of the "Reason", which was formed uniquely (analysis is always subjective), but is <b>never accidental - experience is strictly natural (conforming to laws)</b>;
<br/><br/>
One can stubbornly object to this scheme, denying such correspondences <b><of objects <ins>to</ins> situations></b>. But the World, in its infinite diversity, <ins>exists</ins>, and Everything rotates smoothly without spontaneously colliding. Allow for some randomness ‘On the Scale of the Infinity of the Universe’ is impossible and not rational. That is, it is absurd and absolutely excluded for the <b><em>Purposes of Security of the Entity</em></b>, the World and Being (<i>it threatens the Being of All Alive Beings</i>);
<br/><br/>
The irritation of the Reason by the object <b><i>occurs</i></b> through vibration during the perception of a <ins>static wave</ins>. The extended study of any wave <for the purpose of gaining experience and Development, that is Our Self-development, and Development of the Entity> introduces to the usual error about processuality thus generating and supporting the <strong>Stereotype of Time</strong>, but this (<i>if one can call it that</i>) is the “<ins><i>Costs of the System</i></ins>”. 
<br/><br/>
This <strong><i>‘Amazing Divine Illusion’</i></strong>, is necessarily Its most important main part. At the same time, it is very difficult to compare, i.e. to accept the very fact of the irritation occurring during ‘Receiving an object wave’, because, on the one hand, the wave is static and time is not observed in this case (it does not exist), but on the other hand, we see what is happening and perceive everything as a process. This is exactly the role of the Psychic Function – to make this moment possible, providing, like an instrument, the “<b>Integration of Consciousness and Reason</b>”; that is, the <b><ins>Static</ins></b> and the <b><ins>Dynamic</ins></b>; the Present (Ideas and Conditions) and the Virtual Contemplated: <em>Relations, States of objects, Situations, that is – Everything from which it is possible to extract <valuable> experience</em>;
<br/><br/>
In this very action lies the clue to the impossibility of any static objects. That is, even in a ‘state of rest’ the object is constantly changing, and its mass, shape, and all other parameters are dynamic (<b><ins>This is the Property of Illusion</ins></b>);
<br/><br/>
Here one can suspect ‘maturing indignation of physicists’, but one should not rush with statements. We will have to face problems related to four- and five-dimensionality, at least for a thousand years. This is not long, and then higher dimensions and other problems (tasks) await us (… we won't be bored);
