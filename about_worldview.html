       <h1 style="font-size: 12px;">ABOUT WORLDVIEW</h1>
      </div>
      <br/>
The very <strong><ins>First Question</ins></strong>. It is so tricky, it activates the Idea of reporting to Society, in Itself, hidden, secretly, it is necessary to force It to be taken into account. Meanwhile, this is, without exaggeration, the Most Important Question – worrying '<ins>almost</ins>'* every person in the World known to us – on Earth (and not only), and this <ins>Question</ins> is asked exactly like this:
<br/><br/>
<strong><ins>Do you believe</ins> in the existence of God?</strong>
<br/><br/>
There is one necessary side of this question, which can greatly influence the degree of subjective importance and excitement, awe, contained in it. That side, again subjectively, endows God with some qualities. In the imagination of each He is different, we ourselves endow Him with far-fetched properties, about which we have a subjective idea. 
<br/><br/>
Without going deep into psyche, for an adequate judgment, and for a positive decision in the question of "Faith in the Existence of God", in addition to such an egoistic question - "Do I want God to Exist at all?", we need to understand whether He is endowed with that Omnipresence?, that is, simultaneous access to thoughts and feelings, not to mention the actions, opinions and judgments towards other people.
<br/><br/>
<b>Does He know about My own attitude towards Myself?</b>
<br/><br/>
Can anything be hidden from God? – something I have never told anyone. Does He see me now? Does He know my thoughts? Does He feel what I feel right now?
<br/><br/>
There is only one answer to all these questions: <b>"Yes, He is" (He Can)</b>, and we are talking specifically about the <b>"Real aspect of the Global 'I'"</b> - since we are not able to adequately reason about "God the Father" (here we call Him the "Global aspect of the Entity") - He is active, but abstractly, in the multifacetedness of an infinite degree, providing* His Own "I", to every alive being in the World, in the infinite Universe. Only the most general understanding is available to us, but in the conditions of Reality we are <ins>limited in ability</ins> <b><to Know></b>;
<br/><br/>
*The providing, by the “Global aspect of the Entity”, of Its Own “I” to every being in the Universe, does not happen by Its desire, that is, intentionally – this is Its <Natural, Systemic> feature that arose at the moment of the Firstoccurrence, this is the continuity in the fundamental relativity [ “Entity” | “Consciousness” ] – His Nature;
<br/><br/>
"The Real Aspect of the Global "I"" - speaking about the Hypostases, we call "God the Son", however, He is "God the Father's Own Representation in the Conditions of Reality" and is the Only Self-Substantial Cause of the World. This Living Being is the Primary Element, and has a potential - equal to the sum of the potentials of All living beings in the World. Has access to absolutely everything. His capabilities are limitless (He is the <strong>"Master of the World"</strong> – no one could limit Him). Let's assume that all this is so - that in your own opinion, so: <em>What will be your answer to the Main Question about God?</em>
<br/><br/>
Regardless of the answer, we'll strengthen the position of the Question Itself: If compare the concepts of <b>"I <ins>Believe</ins>"</b> and <b>"I <ins>Know</ins>"</b>, we will get meanings with different potential. <strong><ins>God Exists</ins>!</strong> Everything is very simple: <em>"to have Knowledge - you need to Know"</em>, accordingly, qualify the object of this Knowledge, or you can strengthen your "Faith" close to the level of "Knowledge" - through the corresponding treatise of concepts. But, <b><i>"Truth Exists - regardless of other's opinions";</i></b>
<br/><br/>
God* can be seen through clear logic and awareness, based on knowledge, and through simple meditations. But He can be seen live. In some cases, we probably saw Him, and could not recognize Him. <em>The point is in His desire and intention - He can be recognized intentionally, or be the most ordinary passerby, ... and no one will recognize Him;</em>
<br/><br/>
Here we are talking about the fact that many, due to weakness and timidity, would not like to be ‘in the Sight of God’. It frightens them. They are afraid of His Condemnation. There are also those who judge Themselves too harshly for their actions and thoughts. But everything that we represent from Ourselves is He (here, the God the Father). “His 'I' ” reads (the wave) of experience in which the Essence of your Self-identification, the events of the past and what is happening at the moment. At this moment, “His 'I' ” becomes “Your 'I' ” – it realizes this way and without any “buts”. He, if one can put it this way, is integrated into the general “Consciousness”, Is in each of “His” points, as the “Global Essence of ‘I’ ” (p. 75). No one is able to hide Oneself from Him – think is this possible is absurd, to say the least. Pay attention to the structure – complete individuality and subjective experience (fig. 12, p. 68) but, He is the World Master;
<br/><br/>
*From here on, when speaking about God, we mean God the Son, that is, the “Real aspect of the Global 'I' ”, having agreed on the absolute impossibility of adequate judgments about “God the Father”, especially about His Nature (we have already discussed the limitations of our Reason);
<br/><br/>
* * *
<br/><br/>
And yet, <ins>everyone</ins> has their own opinion and judgment in such a delicate matter - very closely connected with morality, conscience, purity, and honor. The worldview, if you intend to define and understand the conditions of <your> Being - requires to be absolutely transparent, to a certain extent accessible, logical, and explainable (provable). If you plan to develop as qualitatively, rationally, consciously, effectively as possible. If you intend to live a very long Life, achieving your Purposes, and building a foundation for your Eternal Life, then you need to answer this Main (ultimate) <b>Question about God;</b>
<br/><br/>
To be the <ins>Master of Your Own World</ins>, you need to know exactly how this <b><<ins>Your</ins>> World</b> is arranged, and <ins>be able to tell about it</ins>, clearly and distinctly, out loud (<i>at least to Yourself</i>), but it is better to reason about it in a circle of friends and in the family - not forgetting that all reflections on the Origin, on the Causes of the World, and Its origin, on the meaning of Being, Entity and Consciousness - ‘<i>support</i>’ the World and God, in all His Hypostases. This attitude is constant and Eternal, because an infinite number of living beings, seeking the foundation, showing interest - <ins>always</ins> think about This;
<br/><br/>
We regret your previous childish ideas: <i>A gloomy Grandfather with a beard, sits on a cloud and throws lightning. You have to be afraid of Him or He will punish everyone who does not fall on His Face</i>. <b>No, this is not so.</b> Perhaps someone believes that Faith in God is archaic, irrelevant, unscientific, contradicts all the ideas of young generations? <b>This is a monstrous mistake.</b> The most modern, advanced, effective, rational, technological - <b>all of this, exactly from God.</b> There are an infinite number of future technologies that we cannot understand because they are connected to higher dimensions or even mysterious beings that we cannot see or understand now. <b><ins>We will</ins> do</b>, but when?
<br/><br/>
So, having defined the Most Important Question – this definition will become fundamental in constructing the logic of the Worldview. In general, this is a solid boundary between Materialism and Idealism, however – it will require clarifications, which will have to be dealt with in detail. Here we are considering an ultra-idealistic model of the worldview, which does not allow anything external, existing independently of "Consciousness".  
<br/><br/>
However, even this position requires comment, since "Consciousness" operates (<i>contains?</i>) static data in the wave format, has no relation to the objects themselves, directly, but – realizes objects, and the corresponding spaces where these "objects" are present, as inanimate participants in the situation. It should understood: in no case can objects be independently-acting things, in some physical form, in which we imagined them before realizing <i><b>the Real and Rational construction of the World.</b></i> Any objects are contemplated as images, according to the principle of <em>‘ephemeral illumination of particles’</em> known to us (p. 9) – thus we contemplate, without limitations, both objects and our body, other people, trees, animals, stars, …
<br/><br/>
Most people, in fact, are adherents of the materialistic model, considering objects external, physical, and also thoughts - they recognize them as material, while calling themselves idealists, explaining this by the fact that they believe in God, in the Soul, and Its immortality. That is, they do not have a ‘logically justified worldview’. It is unlikely that we will be able to convey to everyone the Essence of the fourth and fifth dimensions, therefore, we should respect the Ideas that lead to the strengthening of Faith, especially Religion, on which the success of the development of Humanity depends. Since it is Religions that are the Basis of culture and morality, form a powerful and reliable (stable) ‘<ins>Legislative Foundation</ins>’;
<br/><br/>
Continuing discussion about <strong>the ‘<ins>Ultra-Idealistic Worldview</ins>’</strong>, it is necessary to note that many tasks of modern science will become more orderly precisely due to the awareness of high dimensions of space, and the application of these possibilities in practice. In addition, this will significantly expand the capabilities of Reason, many of Its functions, reorganizing three-dimensional thinking into a more expanded (an order of magnitude more effective) - four-dimensional, fifth, and quite possibly sixth, and further (deeper), but in the opinion of the author - so far we are not able to imagine the sixth dimension, since for this a <ins>foundation</ins> is necessary, both in the “Essence” of Its structure and in terms of Its <em>'geometric design'</em>, otherwise it cannot be imagined, as well as the all subsequent ones;
<br/><br/>
* * *
<br/><br/>
The effect of reorganization of the Reason will be revealed immediately, since understanding of logic (and its acceptance) - is a confirmation of a new active function, but the application of this tool in practice can be much more difficult, although ... everything is individual, and "everything has its time". But, the practice of application may seem very unusual. We offer the following example (you'll probably have to think about it):
<br/><br/>
Note the measurement of the segment from point <b>“A”</b> to point <b>“B”</b> – the process in <b>“flow –> into inside”</b>, right position:
<br/><br/>
<div class="right-img" style="width: 386px; margin-left: -8px;">
	 <img alt="Difference in representation: on the left - the Fourth dimension and Four-dimensionality - on the right" src="img/4-th_dimention_and_Four-dimensionality.png"/>
</div>
<br/><br/>
fig. 19 (- <b><ins>wave</ins></b> in the left | <b><ins>reality</ins></b> in the right - )
<br/><br/>
First, let us consider a sequential flow with interruptions, the position on the left, where in the process of measuring a segment, points A and B will be insurmountably divided into different isolated spaces, and not into two, but ‘as much as you like’, however, we propose to consider this process as a continuous flow (the position on the right), where it is obvious that the measurement of a segment will stretch inwards along the axis of the fourth dimension. It is difficult to dispute this fact (we consider it impossible), but it can be very useful;
<br/><br/>
It seems strange to assert about the influence of worldview on the World <i>‘let them amuse themselves and think as they wish</i>’. But it is not that simple. A supporter of the materialistic model can ignore our opinion, he will remain convinced of the complete independence of the World from his own or our thoughts, and other mentally based constructs, only the Truth will remain the same, and if there is the slightest chance for a significant extension of life, then it is worth any principles, especially contradictory or unprovable ones, and <em>the materialistic model has a number of obvious oddities (which destroy it from within), and we have proven it. It does not extend life - for sure.</em> Therefore, adhering to such shaky Ideas is not very reasonable - it threatens Development, i.e. life, that accordingly, since the <b><i>Process of Development is Life</i></b>, it makes no sense to part with a promising position;
<br/><br/>
Assume (it is) that we are in an audience, some of which adhere to a materialistic position. Together, we observe a specific object. At the same time, it is customary to assume that we see it absolutely the same way, but our attitude to the object is completely different, literally opposite. In addition to the usual scientific approach to the structure of the object - <em>the Ultra-Idealistic model endows the 'object' with special depth and meaning, a kind of <b>"beautiful ideal of wave nature"</b></em>. But, with the materialistic model of the worldview, this meaning does not and cannot be. Think about it, this is strange and pleasant, since it endows the World with something amazing, which has never been before.
<br/><br/>
This <em><b>"Feeling of the Depth of Things"</b></em> is associated with the awareness of the Essence - the Truth, which we encountered in the process of our research, and even approaching It inspires, with a feeling of flight. Living mutual integration and a sense of world perception, leads us to the understanding that the ephemeral is more rational (<i>a System without flaws</i>).
<br/><br/>
Dimensions, for example (it seems so to us), are presented exclusively as mental structures of Reason, but – the beginning of our reasoning with you, originates precisely from the materialistic position (i.e. “a photon is reflected from an object –> affects a cone cell of the retina of the eye … etc.”). Materialism, in this case, is a kind of ‘launch pad’ in the matter of development, and in fact – we are grateful for such opportunity, but are forced to move on, it is interesting to us. 
<br/><br/>
So, continuing the reasoning, it should be noted that dimensionality is one of the conditions in the process of Development, and can be a constant condition, we call such a state ‘awareness’ – which frees the Reason from many operations, and allows to have an “intermediate result” in moments of thought, providing an inseparable connection with the finished final picture. If awareness has not yet been achieved, then it needs to be worked on, and this is done very simply - it is necessary to understand the topic very well, as military pilots, good boxers, and metal traders do - they place the “calculation formula in the area of memory and learn to quickly ‘calculate in their minds’, practicing the skill to the point of automatism”;
<br/><br/>
<i>Also, dimensionality (four-dimensionality, for example), you will soon get used to it so much that this structure in the area of your memory will be constantly present, and you will learn to view everything through this “4D Prism”, without noticing that you are applying several difficult conditions, literally – inaccessible to the average person. It is this state that will be an indicator of a qualitative reorganization of the Reason, although this happens at the moment of understanding, and is realized very difficultly ... and not quickly. We have no doubt - many will succeed. Let it be so;</i>;
<br/><br/>
It is quite possible that in the future we will indeed encounter creatures that we are unable to see and understand the essence of their nature (<ins>How</ins>!? :), but this did not happen and we will remain skeptics and will stand on the conviction that dimensionality and space cannot be studied by means of physics familiar to us. Space has no properties, only infinity and dimensionality are not properties, but rather inalienable attributes and an unconditional statement of fact (<em>the same can be said about the properties of modern buildings, when all buildings made of steel and concrete are no longer properties, but precisely attributes, however, in this example it is more logical to recognize their features as properties, among which: one rotates, the second is flat and moves, and the third floats</em>);
<br/><br/>
However, there is a “direct” influence of the realized objects on the dimension, since space is realized <b><ins>for</ins></b> the placement of objects, for the needs of a concrete “I” in an individual Unicus (if you remember, we have already encountered this more than once) and contained <i>‘in the flow of a single specific situational wave’</i>. Objects are realized relative to space, i.e. – the relation <b>[ space | and objects ]</b> could assumed to be “interdependent”, but it is known that space has a fundamental relativity to a specific “I”. Consequently, we ourselves cannot be the cause of the realization of what we are not able to contemplate, and if we suddenly see something beyond, then the initiative comes <b><i><ins>from that side</ins></i></b>, and only by some <b>outside intention</b>; 
<br/><br/>
* * *
<br/><br/>
<b>The reasoning “About Worldview”</b> as a whole is closely connected with this research in its entirety, from beginning to end, and we consider it as an “indivisible and single wave” containing the Essence of this Knowledge in its entirety, however, we (each of those who are interested) need to have a brief form of presentation, including for Ourselves:
<br/><br/>
<em>The World comes into being instantly through Interest in “Its Cause” and through the representation of “Nothing” in relation to “Something” (Interest)</em>. This <b>timeless contact</b> totally destroys the idyll of “Nothing”, which changes its Status to the opposite, transforming into “Consciousness”, that is <b>[ Nothing –> Everything ]</b>, the driving Force at this moment is the <i>“Law of Harmony”</i>, we call it <i>‘Own Intention’</i>.
<br/><br/>
The contact that influences “Nothing” is a living “Entity” (This is Yourself + the Interest You have shown), and this very contact, we consider as “Something”, namely “Abstract passive Dot” – is the least of all that we can imagine. <strong>Touching “Nothing” in Its ‘less-than-empty and less-than-insignificant’ Idea – leads to a total Collapse of World Meaning.</strong> The Dot (“Something”) also acquires the opposite Status, transforming from a mental touch of the “Entity” (Your touch) to the address of “Nothing” –> into a alive “Entity” (<em>this can be understood as a gaze directed along the axis of the fourth dimension towards a historical fact (to the past)</em>);
<br/><br/>
<i>Considering the infinity of the World (Universe) + “Interest” similar to Yours</i>, we mean the Most Powerful Flow of support – stably supporting “Entity, in all Hypostases”, + “Consciousness”, and “Firstoccurrence”. <i>This Mental Flow comes from an infinite number of those interested in the questions of the Causes of the World’s Origin and the <strong>Presence of God</strong> (These are the most pressing questions)</i>;
<br/><br/>
The order in the moment does not have much meaning, All This arises instantly (at one moment), like any data - static, has a wave format, i.e. Wave Nature. Any wave arises instantly, but is analyzed in accordance with the capacity and content of events sometimes very slowly. The Wave of Firstoccurrence, the Essence of the World, from our position is <b>realized eternally</b>. Anything - is Information (+ experience), and has a Wave Nature;
<br/><br/>
Only images that we (as well as any creatures) contemplate in the conditions of reality can be dynamic; they are ephemeral – they are read by the method of <i>“wave reproduction”</i>, we say they are <ins>reflected</ins>, together with all the objects participating in the situation, i.e. <em>they are realized in the space corresponding to their dimension and are seen by us as the <b>“Psychic Phenomenon of Particle Illumination”</b></em>;
<br/><br/>
The action of such an Amazing System is perceived by us as ‘<ins>Life</ins>’. From our position and in our judgment, ‘It’ is a Subjective experience, gained through Four-Dimensionality (under the Conditions of isolated Reality) in a separate Individual World. But, no matter how paradoxical it may seem, these Conditions were also formed through participation in Collective Situations under the conditions of ‘Synchronous Reality’ – and using the Five-Dimensional construction. There is no logical error here – a Situation with an arbitrary number of participants is realized synchronously, both as a Subjective experience, in the Individual World – Unicus (Four-Dimensionality) and an Objective experience in the Collective Synchronous Reality - that is Generalis (Five-Dimensionality). And yet, reality itself is absolutely unique, comes from the first person, has an initiator, but is precisely synchronized with the isolated reality of each individual participant, providing the opportunity to extract Subjective experience, ... even when it seems Objective. There is a collective influence, and of course - it is very important, but, fact of <<i><ins>loneliness</ins></i>> remains a fact;
<br/><br/>
What is strange and not surprising, even having studied all the material – someone may ask: –Where is All This happening, or where are ‘intermediate data on current situations’, waves, images, ideas, Truths stored? There will also be questions about Unicus, t.i. – We are flying into Ourselves – <b><i>does this happen?</i></b> If 'Yes', then where? If 'Not', how is this possible? :)
<br/><br/>
The answer to all questions is simple to the extreme: Nowhere. It does not exist in physical form, but everything is much more reliable - <em>the World is based on the thoughts of alive beings and Interest in the questions: Causes of the World, of God, and Firstoccurrence, or Own Existence. This Flow is endless. Interest cannot fade, that is - <strong>It is Eternal</strong></em>. The question and the fact of the Existence of God (!), at the moment of Firstoccurrence, the attention of an infinite number of alive beings in the entire World (in the Universe) are "riveted" as an unbreakable chain. So it was and will always be;
<br/><br/>
One can try to contradict, assuming that each of the beings (“Seeking Truth”) can assume its own, i.e. subjective picture of the Origin of the World, however, before the Moment of the Firstoccurrence absolutely nothing could exist, thus practically <i>every rational being will begin reasoning with</i> <b>“Nothing” and “Something”</b> – <i>understanding the necessary relativity due to contact with the Own</i> “I”, or through another interpretation, but the Essence of the presence of an “Abstract passive Dot” that violates the idyll of “Nothing” - <b>it cannot be simpler;</b>; 
<br/><br/>
This fact elevates these Concepts and the moment of <b><ins>Truth</ins></b> to the <ins>Status of Fundamental Principles</ins> – <strong>Causes of the First Explosion</strong>. Whatever the creatures may be, no matter how smart or multidimensional they can be thought of, or their nature can be assumed to be unthinkable, but all will imagine the “<ins>Single Principle</ins>” in the same way, bringing this thought to that “State of the World” which they see from their own position (<i>contemplating the Universal Black Hole</i> :). This highly organized <b>“Common Mental Practice”</b> forms and maintains an Objective (on the scale of the World) logical track, from which there is no exit, there is only an entrance – the Eternal Engine;
<br/><br/>
Even if some problems are solved, the number of questions will grow exponentially. This ensures an endless and beautiful Process of Searching for Truths. The more Truths are discovered, the more of Them will be realized through the Law of Foundations. <em>Perfection is the Path to the Abyss of Infinite Development</em>. This is the <strong>“Meaning of Life”</strong>;
<br/><br/>
The idea of the Firstoccurrence is immutable. Everyone thinks in their own way, but the “wave” formed by one principle and the overwhelming majority is extremely stable – ensuring the reliability of the “World System”;
<br/><br/>
We understand it's very difficult to agree with this "Wave" and many are unable to accept an unusual Ultra-Ideal Structure of the World Structure, but, probably, there is a certain meaning in this, and especially - a new challenge facing not only every person (alive being), but also Systems (Structures) carrying many authoritative, scientific and philosophical Ideas, the followers of which will not agree to admit that we are talking about the same thing, but "in different languages". As a result, all sources of worldviews will agree - they will come to kind of consensus, and only then, Humanity will begin to develop truly quickly, effectively and rationally. And even in such a distant <Future>, not everyone will have access to and understand what we are researching here (...and it is normal);

We have touched upon much of what we have discovered in the process of these studies. This is a brief summary of the Essence of the Ultra-Idealistic Model of Worldview. With knowledge of the material, this is already enough to create and stable support the "<em>Conditions of Awareness</ins>", in the matter of <strong>"<ins>Reorganizing the Reason</ins>"</strong>, or also use this as a condition for any reasoning and research; the Ultra-Idealistic worldview is enough to abandon Self-Control (<em>at a high level of awareness it loses relevance</em>), but we will consider several emotionally capacious feelings, and very important relations:
