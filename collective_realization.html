       <h1 style="font-size: 12px;">COLLECTIVE REALIZATION OF REALITY</h1>
      </div>
      <br/>
Due to the multidimensionality of Nature of the “Entity” (which means that the “I” itself is multidimensional) – beings are not limited in the number of simultaneously readable “I” waves, which are objects involved in situations <the situations themselves>, “Ideas, and + Conditions – relations, processes, and states of specific objects”. Each object has ‘its own conditions’ (people, participants, dogs, trees, and annoying mosquitoes are also objects). Thus, the contemplated picture is extremely filled with content, multicomponent and infinitely informative, as is each detail and every object. 
<br/><br/>
According to this principle, using the Five-Dimensionality we (I, You, and any number of other beings), from the position of each participant, can be in the “Synchronous Reality” simultaneously. At the same time, each realizes his own isolated Reality (fig. 12), however, the events in it (in the personal Reality of each being) are synchronous with the Reality of other participants. All of them are in the field of vision of each - and see each other, <i>which is implied</i>.
<br/><br/>
It seems this may not happen simultaneously, or – we are not able to prove the actual synchronization, but – given the absence of visible processuality, as it seemed to us before, here we are talking about ‘Illusory Dynamics’ – we can claim complete synchronization, absolute, point-to-point, moreover, the realization is synchronous only in terms of moments of change, although with some special conditions, since any object, for each participant in the situation, is realized differently - from his position, and absolutely individually. Different positions, a completely different view of the situation, all relations are subjective, and even look different. It should not be forgotten that reality is ‘pseudo-common’, and for each person it is realized independently of other participants (absolutely synchronously), in addition, it should be remembered that the wave of the situation is created instantly, but is read in an extended and consistent manner. <strong><em>‘The Five-Dimensionality of the System’</em></strong> provides everything necessary for the Collective participation of beings in any situation – while maintaining the Conditions of complete isolation of Reality and the subjectivity of the participants’ experience. Moreover, both the input data received for combining and for further realization (which means the situation itself as a whole) are unique, as are the analysis and conclusions from the situation being implemented, necessary for extracting new unique experience, and the experience itself is also unique and <ins>exclusively subjective</ins>. In this System, <b>identical!</b> and here it is the <ins>combined data that is objective</ins>, but, upon receipt, they are realized only in the isolated space of each participant (<i>their identity is not only safe, but also necessary</i>); The acquired new experience, and the situation itself, in the previous saved form and further, these data - again participate in the realization of the new reality, as ‘input data’ -> the situation changes, and is analyzed again, and transformed into a new experience -> this dynamic flow (cycle) does not stop. 
<br/><br/>
Collective realization of Reality is very different from the individual one. Through the mutual influence of actions and emotions of each person on each other, in a common situation – it becomes much richer and more intense. Here is the environment of social interaction, and a visual exchange of experience, joint decision-making, and active communication, public emotions, and possible factors are: different religions, the influence of cultures, moral standards, etc., all this influences and accelerates the processes, contributes to their quality and efficiency. Thus, the ‘Entity’ learns by gaining experience through an infinite number of <b>“Real aspects of the 'I'”</b>, and all this is the <b>“Process of Development in the Conditions of Reality”;</b>;
