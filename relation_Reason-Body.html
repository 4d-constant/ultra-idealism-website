     </div>
<br/>
*Within the Ultra-idealistic model, it does not make much sense to explore the relationship <cite>[ "Consciousness" | "Body" ]</cite>, because the thinking instrument here is "Reason" [ Interaction of "I" with Consciousness ]. This implies reading the "Personality Wave" by one of the "Real aspects of the Entity" - literally - "living the role of the Personality" whose wave he reads. This "Wave" contains both the "Essence of Self-identification" and the functionality of the Individually formed Reason, that is, both the Unique Functions of the Mind and the Reason itself as a whole; 
<br/><br/>
This attitude is connected with the existing experience of a specific “<ins>Personality</ins>” (“Real aspect of the Entity”), that is, we assert that the external appearance, as well as the state of the Body, is a <b><i>Psychic Derivative</i></b>: ‘in the aggregate, emotions and all events (or fragments of events)’, which influenced the mental state, causing precisely significant (bright) emotions. In other words: the “Real aspect of the Entity”, realizing (i.e. reading the wave) the experience of a certain being, represents “Itself” in the conditions of reality as a specific Body <of this being> looks like (<i>…psyche -> emotions -> health -> body</i>); 
<br/><br/>
It is meant that "The Appearance of the Body and its State" reflects the existing experience, however, it is necessary to consider not only the experience itself, as content that irritates the psyche, but also the <i><b><ins>subjective attitude</ins></b> of this being to the experience it has lived through</i>. Because a similar experience lived through by two different people will lead one to death from psychosis and heart attack, but the other will be in good health and excellent condition. When considering such an attitude, we need to take into account the <ins>worldview</ins> and other characteristics of a specific person. Yes, this is a deviation from all canons. Here we do not study Other Worldview Concepts, except for the Ultra-Idealistic Model of the World;
<br/><br/>
Therefore, this attitude, as it is known from classical philosophy [ Consciousness | Body ] we associate with the functional features of the Reason, and especially with the character of a person, which has this passive, but key influence on the state of the body (the Main Condition, and static). By the concept of "Human Character" here, we understand His Attitude to any situation, that is, this is the Potential of the Reason and Mind, based, first of all, on the genetic code (DNA), and + a subjective view of "things" - providing such conclusions that include certain "suffering experiences", distorting facial expressions (for example), as a result of which - the face will become distorted, will often wrinkle, and, as a result - will appear in the image of an old and exhausted person. Such consequences also affect the internal organs, spasms, clamps are formed, blood supply is disrupted, and then it is already clear - even the diagnosis is quite predictable;
<br/><br/>
Here, it is probably necessary to choose one of the variants of <ins>causality</ins>, we will perhaps stop at the following model: "psychical cause and psychical effect", because we deny the Material, existing independently and independently, however, Everything absolutely, from the generally recognized physical, safely exists, having the nature of: <strong>Waves (static) + Reality (temporary)</strong>. That is, we can recognize exclusively the mental influence of the Reason on the Body, also what was previously considered an influence from the side of the physical body towards Consciousness - we recognize as mental towards the Reason, but not from the side of the Body, but - taking into account Its state in the Conditions of Reality; 
<br/><br/>
As for the approach to solving the problem (if there is one), we propose to define it as <strong>"<em>neointeractionism</em>"</strong>. Due to new knowledge and discovered conditions - this will retain the previous principle: <b><ins>psychical mutual influence</ins></b>;
