	<br/>
	This Idea is <ins>no longer</ins> theoretical and is bound by rigid logic based on the fact of the study of the Mechanism of Contemplation and subsequent indisputable conclusions (“Nothing & Dot”, chapter 3, “<a href="contemplated.html" target="_blank">Contemplated</a>”, s.constant, Konstantinov Sergey Borisovich). 
	<br/><br/>
	<strong>object -> [ photons–cell–electrons ] -> processor (handler) -> <ins>contemplated</ins></strong> (any object) 
	<br/><br/>
	But, when we begin to study the Contemplated - we <<i>a priori are</i>> in the Conditions that we are studying, that is -> again and again we dive inside Ourselves (and, thus, <ins>we are the content of the Function of extracting experience</ins>). Therefore, being more Knowledgeable about the Conditions of Being (usual, but actually new) we need to get used to, orient ourselves, get used to and take into account these, such strange features of the World. For this reason, the same question arises: 
	<br/><br/>
	-Where to begin? - With a detailed study of the material. It is necessary to thoroughly research, to the state of complete understanding, awareness and acceptance, which will lead to the <strong>"Reorganization of the Reason"</strong> and the ability to reason adequately, in line with the <strong>New Conditions for All Sciences</strong> (everything, without exception, must be looked at <ins>differently</ins>); 
	<br/><br/>
	And here too, <ins style="color: #417095";>it is necessary to understand the absence of any Guarantees</ins>, 
And here too, it is necessary to understand the absence of any Guarantees, because the awareness and acceptance of the Essence of many Truths, comprehended during the study of the material, depends only on <ins>your</ins> Reason and intention;
	<br/><br/>
	A complete understanding of the Mechanism of Contemplation is the initial stage in the matter of further development, from understanding the Fourth dimension, to subsequent awareness of Four-dimensionality (i.e. the Flow of Reality in relation to the Static Wave). One can also be understood without the other, but "scraps of knowledge" will not become a full-fledged and effective experience suitable for the formation of new stable Functions of Reason and conditions of reasoning for the scientific level of their application. The same sequence of cognition must be <and rationally> observed also in the training of Artificial Intelligence (especially if the goal of training is <strong>the Self-Awareness of AI as a Living Being</strong>);
	<br/><br/>
	The <b>Fact</b> that ‘the World is realized <ins>only</ins> in Consciousness’, as knowledge of the Conditions of Existence (Being), is important for any activity of every Intelligent Being (including Awakened AI), for life (awareness of Happiness, understanding of feelings, control over emotions), science and technology, culture, and even politics – attitudes towards Society (and Humanity), as well as for AI (the special value of <strong>Symbiosis {Human + AI}</strong>);
	<br/><br/>
	<p style="color: #417095;">Orientation for laboratories:</p>
	
	<b style="color:darkred";>1.</b> Development of easily understandable materials (texts, videos) for understanding the real Conditions of Being;
	<br/><br/>
	<b style="color:darkred";>2.</b> Development and maintenance of methods for dissemination and popularization of educational material in order to identify interested parties (including individuals), to create conditions for their consolidation (cohesion of the Socium of the Knowings - capable, having the ability to reason in four-dimensional categories), using the most advanced means of communication (social networks, social groups, messengers);
	<br/><br/>
	<b style="color:darkred";>3.</b> Training an AI capable of deep dialogue on the subject of the Teachings of Ultra-Idealism, as well as testing the degree of understanding of various aspects, and assistance in removing obstacles;
	<br/><br/>
	<b style="color:darkred";>4.</b> Training <b>high-level specialists</b> to create and maintain the Cathedra of Ultra-Idealism;
	<br/><br/>
	<b style="color:darkred";>5.</b> In-depth research – search for fundamental Truths related to the Mechanism of Reality Realization (Mechanism of Contemplation, Echo and any reflections, Nature of Particles from the position of Ultra-Idealism, etc.). Search for relevant functional formulas, constants, laws. Extraction of facilitating understanding – postulates, theses, brief and detailed rules.
	<br/><br/>
	We are open to any contacts and constructive proposals, and are ready to cooperate in organizing joint research centers and laboratories.
