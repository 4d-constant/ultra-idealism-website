     </div>
<br/>
We (people) have long been accustomed to division by mental abilities. This obvious, there is a very clear division of Society into those capable and those less endowed with analytical capabilities. The quality of experience of one category differs significantly from another, as does the efficiency, complexity of the functions of Reason. Moreover, the wealthy are in both categories, due to the ‘heritage’ that originates hundreds (and more) of years ago. The Reason of Human, as a species, is always evolving. The complexity of sciences is growing accordingly. This is facilitated by the development of computers and networks. On this powerful basis, including the potential of Humanity, we are witnessing the birth of a new life – Artificial Intelligence (AI), which plays a crucial role. It would seem that the <strong>mixing</strong> factor will gradually equalize the number of these categories + the availability of modern means of communication will help. But this is not happening and the process of this division is already <i>progressing …exponentially;</i>;
<br/><br/>
But, the Entity develops more effectively and more diversified in conditions of maximum differences between beings, i.e. their properties, and the parameters of <ins><b>each</b></ins> Reason;
<br/><br/>
Very soon the division will become more significant, when the <em>Society of those aware of higher dimensions and having an Ultra-Idealistic worldview will grow</em>. We can call them ‘Knowings’, that is, those who think in other categories, using the fourth and fifth dimensions. These Knowings already exist, so far only potentially, in a state of ‘<i>at a crossroads</i>’ between materialism, idealism, and dualism (<i>on the fundamental basis of corpuscular-wave, ‘<ins>still Theory</ins></i>’), they do not know it yet, but they guess reasoning about ding an sich phenomenon that cannot be disputed, but so far they do not openly take a tough position ‘I'm For’. It is very strange, to say the least – to know, but to insist on pleasing, …whom?, and in the hope, for what? – That those who are against development will finally give up their positions, for an understandable natural occasion;
<br/><br/>
This boundary will be strengthened in any case, even if not intentionally, but in the end the 'Ignorants' will stop understand the 'Knowings', while the latter will understand ‘both’. It is not a matter of education level. Among the Ignorant there will be many people with several universities behind them, who do not have certain specific Abilities of Reason to accept proven logical for Truth, with the condition: ‘<strong>It is impossible to dispute the Truth</strong>’, except by means of a direct <strange> denial ‘–Just No and that’s It!’. But why? … The deliberate creation of obstacles to the implementation of new discoveries is qualified as ‘<em><ins>Scientific Terrorism</ins></em>’ – these are acts directed against the Process of Development. The motives of such crimes are different, they are obvious, most of them have a selfish basis, but they harm equally. Separation is necessary, it promotes Development through the motivation (belonging / not belonging) of being among Progressive Humanity and will be a Guarantee excluding Scientific Terrorism in any forms;
<br/><br/>
One can assume ‘<em>psychical traumas</em>’ in connection with the awareness of the fact of inferiority, but the same fact probably traumatizes the beggar in relation to the millionaire and no one suffers from this <<i>except the beggar himself</i>>, on the contrary – everyone knows the beneficial influence of this factor, it is considered a <strong>morally positive stimulus</strong>. The only difference is that the rich differ from the poor in appearance and the state of the account and the ‘Ignorants’ differs from the ‘Knowings’ in the culture of speech, and its open meaning;
