      <br/>
      Nowadays it is fashionable to “practice trying to control reality”, but few people are able to even approximately explain and answer the question: What is “Reality”? For this reason, the result of the practices turns out to be practically zero - since the practitioners have no idea in what conditions they are trying to act, with the intention of influencing the basis for the realization of things and the formation of situations. It is available, but the skill will require a lot of knowledge. At the same time, both the practice itself and the results will be perceived by other, ignorant people as "Magic";
<br/><br/>  
Science. Is it possible to study something you don’t know about? And, as it turned out, something works, but – looking at the result, we are not able to identify it and qualify it adequately, as well as what we worked on and how we did it. And this because we act in unknown conditions. We know practically nothing about the ‘Structure of the World’ and, accordingly, we do not understand, What this, the World?
<br/><br/>
It turns out that we know nothing about Ourselves, nor about the World we live in, nor about Reality, and we try to control all of this. In this statement of fact, of course, there is ‘no hopelessness’, and on the contrary - there is certainty and interest in life, a desire for development, an intention to study and know. Although, in a nutshell, the essence is most often in the attitude to what is in itself, i.e. we will have to adapt - this is the attitude to the Surrounding Dangerous World | or, to the fact that everything in the World exists for us, and we should simply use it for its intended purpose and Develop by gaining experience, then any danger is perceived as a delusion of reason, that is, as an ordinary task that will have to be solved in order to save life, or - lose relevance;
