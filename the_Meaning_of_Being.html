     <h1 style="font-size: 12px;">THE MEANING OF BEING</h1>
     </div>
     <br/>
Analysis of childhood actions, as well as the experience of observing other children, proves that the ‘Reason’ develops from ‘zero’, originating in the process of active struggle between the tailed carriers of the ‘<ins>part of the gene code</ins>’ – that is, the future <b><i>‘Identifier of a specific “I”’</i></b>, and then, together with the embryo, being influenced by the process of ontogenesis, the ‘Reason’ is formed in an absolutely unique way and, together with the embryo, goes through all the stages of the organism’s development. These numerous processes are very complex, connected with the psyche and all situations, individual, and therefore have a very special influence on the <i>‘Development of Functions’</i> <of the Reason>;
<br/><br/>
After birth, the organization of mental activity begins in the conditions of reality, based on practice - experience gained as a result of analyzing situations and one's reflexes, feelings and sensations, discomfort, hunger, pain, influence of instinctive behavior on Reason: interest, fear, and further, through mental trauma experience: lies, betrayal, falsehood, resentment, love. 
<br/><br/>
<b><i>Extremes form the most effective functions;</i></b>
<br/><br/>
Here, it is not at all necessary to assume about radical tests. No. Everything is as simple as possible. The natural development of the Reason is unique, and acquires different efficiency. The more significant events and life situations that force one to make decisions on which, let's say very mildly, "well-being" depends - the Reason is formed faster, develops with maximum quality. In addition, for obvious reasons, each "Reason" differs in the number of functions, and their quality, structure, other parameters, of which, we believe, there are an extremely large number, but each of them, directly or indirectly, is connected with Development. Even emergency functions responsible for safety, including the well-known instinct of self-preservation, one way or another - protect opportunities, and guard <all without exception>, the processes of "Development" (You already understood why); 
<br/><br/>
We can try to dispute it, but anything that does not develop dies, and immediately, and quickly disappears. This is obvious and correct. Each “I” has a huge significance for the “Entity”, therefore the <i>complete absence of its actuality and development prospects is immediately blocked by breaking the</i> <b>“I + Body”</b> <i>tandem that exists in the conditions of Reality.</i> <b>Disconnecting from the “I”, the body immediately dies;</b> 
<br/><br/>
In this case, the “I” returns control over the next ‘Its body of this Personality’. Apparently, this is so (pp. 55-57), because the “I” leaves the ‘current body which under control’ during sleep, and controlling another body. But, once again, it should be taken into account that that body is also ours, and the same one at that (the body is implied by a certain Prototype, and the “Idea” here). At the same time, nothing special or unusual happens. As it does not happen after deep sleep. Only the reason for the transfer control of another body can be different.  <i>Deactivation of the body for (or before) sleep - <ins>theoretically</ins> erases all boundaries between Life and Death</i>;
<br/><br/>
However, do not think that by leaving the killed body, you can find a better life. This is not so. The ‘essence of the established problem in development will not allow to provide anything more comfortable for you. It is not the alive being that decides, but the ‘System’. You will have to learn to love yourself and any life, especially a difficult one, filled with difficulties. You do not need to tempt Destiny <that is “Entity and Consciousness”>, for the presence of some bugs (errors) - they do not exist, just as there is no “luck (or unluck)”; 
<br/><br/>

It is hardly possible to imagine how huge our potential is and what we are really capable of. “Eternity” is not the limit, believe me. So, regarding the very pressing and important question: <b>What is the meaning of life?</b> Let answer this way:
<br/><br/>
<b>The Meaning of Life in Development</b> – understanding this postulate is usually quite sufficient for a rational approach to a quality life process, and probably a long life, if the Purposes <turn out to be> aimed at objective development: of Oneself, Society, Humanity; It would be better to understand <b>What is “Development” for the “Entity”?</b> We want to find out, study, understand and realize this;
<br/><br/>
<b>The Meaning of Eternal Life is in Eternal Development</b> – this postulate implies the awareness of weighty Reasons why "Eternal Life" is necessary as a tool and a mandatory Condition. Judging by the surveys, most people think differently. Many people recognize Body Culture, Sports as development. Most of them would not like to live forever (..this is an unconscious choice). Almost no one named the "Reason" that is the basis for "Eternal Life". But, a few answered positively, and immediately named the "Purposes" - for the realization of which "Eternity" is really necessary. This confirms that - <b>"Life expectancy depends on the Purposes";</b>; 
<br/><br/>
<b><ins>Purposes</ins></b>, as the basis of ‘Eternal Life’ must be clear and specific, but endless in the process of achievement, that is, they are not achievable in practice, but strive for impossible Perfection, Ideal, but Better: quality, qualification level, condition, level of knowledge. We will give a couple of examples, <in fact> of Eternal Purposes: “Development and Improvement of the Legislative System”; or – “Development of technologies that increase the speed of data transfer”. That is, it is possible to endlessly study and develop only that which will always be in demand and relevant for Society, which cannot be recognized in its completed form – Developing;
<br/><br/>
<b><ins>Limitations - there are none</ins>.</b> -But, should we assume their presence? - Yes. It is, at the very least, rational. That is, it is necessary, due to the observance of <i>"Timeliness" (here) - accessible and understandable logical synchronization of Information in the <current> Society</i>. These restrictions are not mandatory, of course, but <i>"Development" is determined by comparison - when there is a possibility to compare something "reasonably comparable", albeit to some extent</i>. In order to be useful, it is very important and necessary to understand and evaluate the environment, to delve into the Essence of the <ins>Social Environment</ins>, to determine the interests and general depth of the logic of the audience. What is the use of lectures on <i>“String Theory”</i> in kindergarten? – but, you can instill in children a love of arithmetic, for example, or interest schoolchildren in elementary grades in learning physics and chemistry with an eye to a new business in the future, and even a <b><i>monologue</i></b> can be useful and constructive if the listeners understand it, analyze it, and gain valuable experience. It would seem that it is possible to develop being completely alone, this is precisely absurd because “Entity” represents “Itself” <b>‘<ins>multi-facedness</ins></b> and <b>multi-personality’</b>. <i>Through Its Nature, the “Great Single 'I' ” and the “Real Aspects of the Entity”, <b>“Society” is a Fundamental Property of the World;</b></i>
