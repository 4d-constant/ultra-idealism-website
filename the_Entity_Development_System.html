     <h1 style="font-size: 12px;">THE 'ENTITY' DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM</h1>
     </div>
      <br/>
There are clear Signs that point in the right direction. We suggest you use them as a guide to begin your exploration or simply <i>to always stay on the True Path</i>. The indicator may seem strange, insignificant - we mentioned it once with a suggestion to remember, and it was <i>"The Moment of feeling easy Pleasure"</i>. We call this pleasure - <strong>"Investment of the Entity in Development"</strong>. Look at the known, obvious signs:
<br/><br/>
<strong>Love</strong> – provides several directions with very high guarantees of "Entity Development". Attractiveness in Love is stimulated by pronounced feeling of euphoria, pleasure, sexual attraction, which in turn, is stimulated by euphoria, and is accompanied by a 'bright' feeling of pleasure. But, Love (in itself) is not a direct pleasure, immediately, it is a rather complex mental “mobilization of feelings” (attractiveness + sexual attraction). The essence of this Feeling is connected with the Instinct of reproduction (more often), and the complete correspondence of partners for the conception of a fetus, successful and promising from the standpoint of the <b>Entity Development System</b> - high-quality, from which specific results are expected, and this child will certainly be capable of what is expected of him. <b><em>The "System" invests pleasure reliably and in advance</em></b>, on the eve of the relationship - literally inclining to actions of a sexual nature, and to sex itself, i.e. directly. During this period, and during the relationship, lovers find each other very attractive, amazing so much that - manners, any facial expression, gesture, look, voice, every movement - causes a feeling of delight, enchanting pleasure. Experiencing Love in an object, something beautiful and new is constantly discovered and “some kind of discovery occurs” – causing a wave of pleasure in every moment. Love is one of the most beautiful feelings available to a person (creature);
<br/><br/>
<em>Showing a frank interest (and big care) in Development, the ‘System’ is guided by the data of the Wave Nature, ‘ignoring’ the Spiritual and other values – <personally> relevant in the conditions of reality.</em> The cold, calculating ‘System’, from our position (because we do not understand the true Essence of the Development process), as it seems to us, has no pity, conscience, compassion. That is, It (the System) does not know and does not take into account human laws, rules and moral norms, and the only thing the ‘System’ cares about with the utmost quality is the ‘Development of the Entity’. The stability, security, Being and diversity of the World depend on this process <we understand this as a very good reason>. Here, the question may arise:
<br/><br/>
– How does the ‘System of Development of the Entity’ relate to the diversity of the World?
<br/><br/>
– It has the most direct relation. For insight, one should concentrate, imagine the interdependence between the degree of quality to which we are able to imagine “Nothing”, and exactly to the same degree we receive the World, in a ready-made form, and the purer this idea is, the more diverse and beautiful It (the World) will appear to us in the conditions of the realization of reality in practice, immediately, one should only once deeply think about this “Nothing” – in order to search for the ‘Causes of the World and Its Own Foundations’; In addition to the feeling of Love, the “System” uses several “psychic categories”, in which pleasure, euphoria, joy … and selflessness are also invested.
<br/><br/>
The latter can be associated with the concept of “Holiness”, but accuracy in judgments is important in order not to make a mistake; If we talk specifically about the diversity of the World - the more diverse it is, the more diverse experience can be available in the matter of Entity Development. The System uses absolutely all possibilities for this;
<br/><br/>
<strong>Interest</strong> – stimulation of exploration, a sense of achievement, or a logical conclusion, culminating in euphoria pleasure. It is very interesting that the result of the search is encouraged when you have been trying with interest to find something very desirable and necessary for a long time, and suddenly you have found what you were looking for - at that moment, a familiar "Wave of Light Pleasure" will roll through your entire body - this is the "Investment of the Entity in Development", a reward, sometimes in advance, especially when the result is close. Many people are familiar with this feeling. The Inquisitive Mind often leads to this feeling. The "System" tries to form a dependency in a person, so that he always explores, searches for something new. Does this seem exploitate? - this thought cannot be correct in relation to the "Entity" and "Consciousness" <and has a direct relation to self-eating>;
<br/><br/>
<i>The warmest feelings can be considered adequate in relation to the “Entity”: Love, Gratitude, Admiration. “The Real Aspect of the Global 'I' ” is the Most Miracle Being (the Essence and Cause of the World);</i>;
<br/><br/>
–  –  –
<br/><br/>
Interest, by the way, immediately removes drowsiness (it looks like – “I” changed Its mind to support another body, because it is very interesting here), when a reason is found that causes surprise, and even ‘many ailments leave the body of an enthusiastic researcher when approaching the Truth’. This is amazing. Whoever has encountered this – he understands and appreciates ‘the meaning of this phenomenon’;
<br/><br/>
–  –  –
<br/><br/>
Pleasures of an unnatural nature, without a conscious sense of moderation, not connected with development – are harmful to man and any living being, because pleasure is a instrument ('stimulus') of the ‘System of Development of the Entity’, however, even if it is an unintentional falsification, it causes an understandable error in the fundamental relations [teaching / knowledge] –> [achievement / encouragement]. 
<br/><br/>
Due to this deviation, an imbalance arises and the ‘Law of Harmony’ acts on Consciousness, restoring the necessary Balance. Such counteractions cause ‘ailments’, which must be accepted as a warning. If it is ignored, then further events, the ‘ignorant’ will perceive as anger –> censure, and subsequent ones as punishment –> and then destruction; 
<br/><br/>
It is explained very simply - the resulting imbalance is not allowed, as it threatens the World. This does not mean that an alcoholic and a drug addict are a threat to the Galaxy, for example. That is not the point. But "Law is Law" and functions the same way at the 'Systemic level', both on the scale of the Universe and within the nucleus of an one atom;
<br/><br/>
<i>The imbalance in the wave arises instantly, simultaneously with Its elimination, but – to comprehend the essence, it is necessary to explore, gain experience in the Conditions of Reality, that is – to consistently experience and analyze;</i>;
<br/><br/>
<i><ins>Dependence</ins> on unnatural pleasures <including fornication> causes a ‘Metaphysical Illness (fail)’, which prevents the possibility of determining the ‘True Path of Development’</i>, because pleasure is an indicator and stimulant (investment of the Entity), but the patient is unable to appreciate such subtle sensations, being content with the gross ones, received in extreme excess, i.e. ‘<i><ins>without measure</ins></i>’. <ins>Measure makes a big difference</ins>. Up to a certain point, the pleasure is <b>genuine</b> (research and experience, for example through LSD and other means), but – <ins>soon</ins> the experience dries up, because the same type of events become looped, losing their relevance – the perspective, in such a case, disappears, with consequences;
<br/><br/>
<strong>Friendship</strong> – the harmony of <ins>true</ins> friendly relations, is an achievement in the social plan and is encouraged a little differently (then love). Collective experience, here it is recommended to understand as interaction, 
i.e. has in this case a special effect based on mutual understanding and coincidence of many preferences, this eliminates the ‘information fog’ – various types of competitive and other feelings of <hidden> bias, hostility, rejection or disgust – which provides ‘ideal conditions for extracting experience ‘in its purer form’, so to speak. In addition, as they say – ‘two heads much better than one’, of course. For these reasons, Friendship has a special meaning for the ‘System’. Particularly successful results of collective interaction are encouraged by euphoria and pleasure also. Many members of sports teams and research workers working in a close-knit team are familiar with these feelings (even if not all, but the Essence is more clearer to someone who has already felt it); 
<br/><br/>
<strong><ins>Happiness</ins></strong> - is a special <ins>Divine</ins> state of the "Real aspect of the Entity" that revels in the life Process and is Grateful for Being, sincerely loving Society, Life, and Himself <realizing the Magnificence of the World>; The constant interest of the "Development System" (towards a happy being, human) lies in the value of the pure experience he extracts, devoid of negative feelings, emotions, judgments. A high degree of adequacy is ensured by his calmness and the absence of any negative experiences. In addition, a happy person analyzes much more deeply, clearly understands emotions, and distinguishes, for example, between "fear" and "excitement". 
<br/><br/>
Happiness, is a stable state resulting from complete awareness, indivisible and absolute, i.e. it is impossible to be happier or less happy, however, one can be strictly and definitely <b>“Happy” or “Unhappy”</b>, ... there is no other;
<br/><br/>
Happiness is <b>realized only once</b>, and will <ins>never</ins> leave, regardless of the conditions, in any situation. The happy will not become unhappy, but vice versa - the Unhappy can make Himself happy. To realize happiness, you need awareness - a complete understanding of <ins>these two postulates</ins> and quite pleasant practices that have become a "Way of Life":
<br/><br/><b>
1). This is how it should be (experience and development);
<br/><br/>
2). The only ‘best case’ scenario is being realized*. </b>
<br/><br/>
*With due understanding, p.1 and p.2 have the same basis;
<br/><br/>
A). The first postulate is a conclusion, as an inevitable Consequence of the second postulate. But, as a result, it is understood first, after <the corresponding level> of awareness.
<br/><br/>
B). The second postulate says that any events that happen to a specific “Creature” are necessary for effective development, and contain the Corresponding Experience – the most rational, and precisely the timely necessary, the best of all available. That is, the Situation is the best option of all possible, because there are no accidents (<em>risk with the World and the Entity is impossible</em>), there is only the <b>‘Best Option’</b>, but it is a <ins>formal option</ins> (no other) – like choosing NaCl for pickling vegetables, from a huge list of salts that are completely unsuitable;
<br/><br/>
It is far from certain that the valuable experience contained in each event will be extracted as expected (often it is not), which is quite understandable, but does not interfere with the Postulate and does not distort Its essence in any way. There are no random Situations, and each moment should only be enjoyed - thanked for the best (it should be remembered that this is so and not otherwise). It is necessary to be attentive, to analyze situations in order to discover the rational (there is no negativity in them, if it seems that there is - this is a measure of ignorance);
<br/><br/>
We ourselves say "God's Will for everything" and dare to be indignant - this is nonsense, outrageous and unacceptable, <i>at the very least</i>;
<br/><br/>
So, let's say you understood the Essence of the postulates. Load both Postulates into the area of your <b>"real time access memory"</b>, from now on you should remember them (if you want to be happy). When you learn to apply these Postulates in practice, you will understand that you are Happy and will always treat any situation with Gratitude;
<br/><br/>
Practice the following in conjunction with the First Postulate:
<br/><br/>
<b>Practice of Truth</b> – <ins>never tell a lie, nothing false</ins> (except in an open game or as a obvious joke), here we mean any lie or misinformation, even the most trivial and insignificant, as it seems. Do not lie to anyone, not to small children, not to adults, not to a police officer, not to a passer-by - the answer may be: I cannot say that, or shrug your shoulders in bewilderment, you can refuse to speak, or speak on some topic, or just remain silent (- this is often the best choice). You can appear in court, fulfilling your civic duty, but giving truthful testimony, excluding your own opinion (only facts without assumptions), without emotions, fantasies and speculations, but never lie. You cannot allow testimony as revenge, because of bribery, for any other reason - pursuing interests, your own enrichment, career, and other benefits and advantages. Participation in a conviction is a very negative position, unless you are an <ins>official</ins> <b>‘Law Enforcer’</b>, or a Military Tribunal, in the performance of your official duties, under a contract (<ins>namely legally</ins>), implying Sincere service (under an agreement, contract, agreement, including ‘your given Word of Honour’), or service to your Homeland (Oath, Military Oath);
<br/><br/>
<b>Practice of Honor</b> – is built first on the attitude towards Yourself, namely with Honor, that is, if you say that you will do <this or that>, indicating the terms, then - it is unacceptable not to do it on time, or, let's say, money on loan - if you take it for a certain period - return it on the hour, or earlier. If you took money without a term (from a Friend), then you should agree that this is an open-ended debt. Probably, from a Friend, on loan at interest, for a certain period - then secure it with an Honest Word (if you are really <b>Friends</b> <ins>mutually</ins> and <i>with a Capital letter</i>, then the Word is enough).
<br/><br/>
If you borrow from a friend, then it is necessary to document the allocation of funds, whether it is a loan, a gift, or a gratuitous gift. The point is that this promise must be absolutely pure to Preserve Honor. If, as is usually done, you borrow a small amount for any period of time, from anyone, then return the money within the established period, no matter under what conditions you borrowed it - under what circumstances, or in what way. The same applies to the Word of Honor - Remember that there are no compelling reasons to break the "Given Word", except for your own death, loss of consciousness, or another grave reason that <b><ins>irresistibly</ins></b> deprives you of the opportunity to keep your Word. Otherwise, if you are able to restrain Him, but did not do so - your Honor will suffer, until the one to whom you gave the Word, does not release you from those obligations, and sincerely. Let's say a Person gave the Word, but broke his leg - He will have to take a taxi in order not to break the Word He gave. If this is not possible, then you need to use the phone, and keep up to date with the events, or <b><ins>Ask</ins></b> for a Delay of the Word;
<br/><br/>
Few People in the modern World value Their Honor as much as it is necessary. But, They are and always will be;
<br/><br/>
<b>Practice of Conscience</b> – is based on the fact of obvious presence of self-oppression, when you condemn yourself in this or that deception, forgery, committing an act qualified as vile and unworthy. In this case, the best way to get rid of it is to sincerely apologize to the victim, pay off, but only in those ways that are established by the decision of the victim. If this is impossible and the victim is not present at all, or he clearly insists on ‘your condemnation’ - then you will have to bear punishment through the court, or choose a method that completely suits the victim, freeing you from guilt and self-condemnation (while preserving your life and not harming your health). It can be prayer, service, and a monastery, or other ‘atonement’. Conscience must be pure, that is – it requires constant care, corresponding spiritual purity, discipline and attention – do not allow the loss of Conscience, then you will not have to suffer in the atonement of deeds. Otherwise, you yourself, with your own hands – will build “Hell” for yourself. It will not be somewhere, in a fairy-tale Abyss – it will be here, and it will be visible, and perceptible, only to you … but, all your life;
<br/><br/>
<b>Your strictest judge is Yourself ('I');</b>
<br/><br/>
Any provocation of the <b>Law of Harmony</b>, such as disorientation of the Entity, deliberate encroachment on the reliability of data, the authenticity of information, the Truth, as well as the substitution or distortion of the Truth, violation of Honor, loss of Conscience - this is harm, to Oneself first of all, but equally to the "Global aspect of the Entity", and the "Real aspect of the Global 'I' ". Everything Is Entity;
<br/><br/>
<strong>Be Happy - it's very simple;</strong>
<br/><br/>
Some of the readers, having snatched a piece of text that did not understand the Essence, may probably think that it is possible to pretend, obviously turning out to be a “conscientious, truthful ambitious person”, in the hope that suddenly: life will improve, Happiness :), health will appear, but with such thoughts one can only turn into an ‘Evil Clown’ for the public – unhappy until the end of days.
<br/><br/>
Never think and do not hope in your thoughts, for the possibility of <em>hiding anything from the Essence is <ins>absurd</ins></em>;
