     </div>
     <br/>
Obviously, we are not alone. This is wonderful. Everything we know and everything we can do - we received from those who were around, and they, in turn, learned it from other people. Society is a carrier of information and an inexhaustible source of almost all opportunities, knowledge and skills, not excluding those that seem banal: the ability to speak, to use the simplest things - to eat with a spoon, to maintain posture while standing on two legs, etc. It is to Society that we owe our existence as Homo sapiens. History, Science, and Culture, for all this, we sincerely thank specific people, our family, the closest Society, Society, and Humanity as a whole. It is a pity that some people treat this with a certain smirk.  
<br/><br/>
- - -
<br/><br/>
All participants in real events play a huge role in the formation of experience, and are often the main initiators, while we only observe (... as it seems to us). Humanity is developing under the pressure of many factors, ancient stereotypes, foundations, infected with numerous authoritative opinions, up to the most delusional (each at own level), and is subject to the influence of dozens, or even hundreds - teachings and false teachings.
<br/><br/>
Although, theoretically, there may be a universal, “Adaptive Worldview” – which does not contradict the basic teachings (respected, necessary, ofcource) teachings having the status of, literally, ‘honorable and fundamental’, that is – not because of the ‘technology of penetratingly tormenting exposition’, but precisely ‘by the Essence of the content and enormous significance for Society’. The meaning of this study will not allow you to make a mistake and contradict the conclusion: 
<br/><br/>
<b>Society (the object of attention and sincere care) is the thinking part of myself <from the position of each>;</b>
<br/><br/>
Understanding the essence of the "Entity" calls for showing all kinds of care and attention to people, to Humanity and Society. A person with a worldview that identifies Himself with the World is imbued with universal mutual love, is not capable of starting a war, offending another person, or harming anyone - everything he sees is dear to him, because he perceives the World as Himself - having all the necessary grounds for this, which is important. 
<br/><br/>
This concept activates the intention of the "I" to learn and develop in all directions. A person caring about society, begins to make discoveries, to understand the meaning of existence and the need to live as long as possible - thereby forming a conscious Path to Eternity, preserving the Own "I" unchanged, not having lost its 'self-identification'. These are purely personal <one's> subjective criteria and qualifications, which a person can judge exclusively independently;
<br/><br/>
* * *
<br/><br/>
Reasoning, here, we are dealing with morality, however, we need to understand, discarding all emotions. Studying the mechanism of contemplation, we came to the conclusion about the conditions of absolute isolation. Based on this, the World is realized individually, that is - we cannot assert what is primary - "I" or "Humanity"?, as anything realized in space turns out to be secondary for us. When we begin any discussions about the “I” and its nature, we assume that we are talking about the Cause of the World, and the Essence of the Beginnings, at the moment of the “First Origin”. In complete isolation, we cannot assume any other Beginning except the “I”. That is, the first moment of opening eyes is precisely the Birth of the World, or the 'First Explosion'. While this is so;
<br/><br/>
Other people, including our parents, are discovered (realized) only after our birth, and we do not remember the moment of our birth, just as we cannot be aware of the moment of our own death, but we observe how they (others) are born and die - this is a fact of the fundamental difference of "I" and "Not I". Further: It is necessary to ignore all emotions. What is the true sequence of These Events? Does it exist at all, this sequence?, or is the moment of reality so ‘fictitious’ that some “things” are not important at all? What is the Cause, and of What? The list of these questions looks bold, but the obvious is not even debatable. Considering the individually realized space and absolute isolation, it is possible to assert - we realized our parents as a foundation, and this is undeniable. Among other things, considering the fact that ‘Everything has a Foundation’ - the realization of parents is necessary, but again ‘exclusively by fact - after birth’, i.e. - after the Act of emergence. 
<br/><br/>
This assumes that we (meaning the “I” of each from His own position) – Are the Cause of everything, in the absolute sense, as well as all relatives without exception, including ‘great-great-…-grandmothers’ to any generation – which are realized simultaneously and quite naturally, as the need to have causes (reasons): for parents, and after them the cause of grandmothers, and great-grandmothers, etc. As we said above, this relates to the main differences, where the fundamental (each) “Proper I”, in any rational logic will turn out to be the ‘First Cause’. From this position we consider both the structure of the Universe, implying “Itself”, and the Nature of the “Entity”, as well as what is connected with the questions posed here: What Am I? and, How is the World structured? 
<br/><br/>
All this is logical, but too rigid <and especially from the point of view of the layman>. As before – the Solipsistic structure of the World is indestructible; But ...
<br/><br/>
<b>Reason versus the Radical-Pragmatic System;</b>
<br/><br/>
Sometime, in thousands of years, we will change so much that we will come to a calculating rational culture and psyche. This will eventually entail: Mixing of races and Mutual integration of all Cultures that arose on the Planet - therefore, here, we all peoples arose, and we develop many cultures in order to create a single, but richer, and more flexible, complex, thus - beautiful, maximally effective, as a great and <b>perfect Tool for the Development of Civilization</b>. This is an interesting and complex topic, probably worth paying attention to, given the conflicts and disagreements of peoples due to different cultures and religions - which, however, are also political raw material for vile provocations, military conflicts, territorial disputes. This is not a dream at all. This is <ins>inevitability</ins>. Therefore, <b>the Philosophy of Peace is relevant</b>.
<br/><br/>
* * *
<br/><br/>
Since we have decided to investigate, let us continue our reasoning and try to discover fundamental grounds with the help of which it will be possible to prove the Existence of other people, and their actual participation in the events we observe. Perhaps, We (Humanity) have already encountered such problems due to the limitation of dimensionality, including the thinking ability of Reason. If we think in three-dimensional categories, there can be no positive result, due to the natural systemic barrier.
<br/><br/>
We have previously found out – the Dimensionality Barrier is overcome through understanding the ‘<ins>Essence of the Structure</ins>’, a clear understanding of the ‘Reasonable and detailed logical Device’, and the ‘Geometric representation’ – there is no other way and cannot be. We consider this very positive :), since the study and acceptance cannot be widespread, due to psychological and socio-psychological factors.
