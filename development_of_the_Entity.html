       <h1 style="font-size: 12px;">DEVELOPMENT OF 'ENTITY'</h1>
      </div>
      <br/>
<i><b>‘Reading a wave’</b></i> – is comparable to playing music from a static wave recorded in a file. You can read a wave, extracting the sound it contains, but as a wave, it is absolutely <ins>static and passive</ins> – that is how everything in the World works. <strong>Entity is not limited by anything</strong>, It <ins>instantly</ins> creates a wave of any complexity, but in order to understand this Creation in detail, it takes years, hundreds and thousands, and sometimes billions of years. Time does not matter to the Entity as well as distance and extension. But, to comprehend the essence, we need a process, so we will listen to the sound for some time while reading a sound wave, or observe the life of a Star - ten billion years, also reading a wave, exploring in the process and carefully - thousands of waves simultaneously in one package;
<br/><br/>
It is unlikely that we should think about this constantly, and keep it as a condition, but now we analyze for the purpose of study, and we understand that the Star (the Sun, for example) has a main purpose - <ins>data transport</ins> by means of photons, and serves precisely for the alive. But, ‘Development is Life’, therefore the Star System is part of the conditions for Life and, most importantly, Serves the cause of Development, i.e. if we assume that the volume of experience in the System is limited even with the special activity of the Intelligent, then out of 8-12 billion years we have only half the term left, to have time to move to another System rich in new experience; 
<br/><br/>
Human has to solve a number of difficult tasks. If we do not do this, we will not be able to get out and will have to stay here ‘until the very end’. If the Sun swells into a giant :(, there will be no conditions for life (this is zeroing). "The Entity" shows us the Way. We must act even if nothing threatens, ...or will begin to threaten, because there is only that which Develops;
<br/><br/>
<b>–And what are these Tasks? 
<br/><br/>
–These are very important technologies: 
<br/><br/>
	 1. Teleportation; <br/>
	 2. Instant signal transmission. 
<br/><br/>
The process of development is inextricably linked with reality, since this is the only way to "get data" for their analysis, selection and further qualification into the most valuable knowledge, that is, into experience. The value <knowledge> of experience is determined by the possibility of using it as a rule, a logical template, allowing one to make subjectively correct decisions that ensure: development, that is, safety (here, probably, health and prolongation of life), well-being and recognition as a worthy member of a "characteristically close socium", and general life comfort. The most universal templates are recognized <or even turn out to be> the Fundamental Laws, which form the main functions of Reason. 
<br/><br/>
The more objectively qualitative, effective experience is available, the more regularities are discovered, and the possibilities for extracting even more qualitative experience. Each regularity, from those discovered by us in experience, forms the corresponding Function and + Condition, the superstructure of Reason. The more functions provide for the extraction of qualitative experience, the greater prospects the "Being" (Man, in our case) has;
<br/><br/>
The presence of a prospect of rational development determines the relevance of further life. But, life becomes irrelevant and ceases exactly at the moment when the 'Prospect of Development' completely disappears. People often make mistakes in determining the prospect, observing the death of other people, but the "Entity", as a "Global System" - cannot make mistakes, this is initially embedded in "Its" structure, in the design of the "System Itself". The world could not exist in the presence of any errors, and any probabilities other than single ones (in cage) – acceptable in the Conditions of Reality, or reasonably necessary, provided for in some special environments (in some simulators, or in slot machines, etc);
<br/><br/>
What exactly provides the Prospect of Development? – this is a really difficult question. Probably, we are mistaken in something, but we are able to try: Those who provide relevance and prospect of others, many, will have to be recognized as promising, that is – it can be a technology developing Humanity, however, one discovery will not be enough, a stable stream of discoveries is needed. Let this be only a subjective opinion, but as knowledge, it will not change. That is, as we said before – to ensure Eternity, it is necessary to have foundations, also for a long life, it is the Path that is needed, that is, the Purpose, for realization of which, someone specific and irreplaceable, must live, let's say, several thousand years, or even much more. 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Development defines the perspective as the relevance and necessary duration of life.</strong> It remains for us to understand the rules of qualification of the "Fact of Development" from the position of the Entity. However, do we have the right to interfere with the System?, using "<i>one size fits all</i>" - to name something specific, but in any case subjective. No. This is unacceptable, and even unpleasant (we have already given a couple of examples) - the Entity needs a unique experience of different "Real aspects of the 'I' ", and let it be (must) chosen subjectively, but intentionally. 
<br/><br/>
A well-known wisdom says: 
<br/><br/>
"Every experience is positive and instructive. Negative experience does not exist" – but we prefer to look for only effective and rational experience (<i><ins>from our own positions</ins></i>);
