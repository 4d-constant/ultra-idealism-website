      <br/>
The Entity (here) is a logically defined, unique alive Monad, capable of manifesting a special intention – Actively Developing, as well as contributing to the Development of Its independent manifestations, which have their Own Will, are conceptually dependent and inseparable from It. The Monad (here) – we mean a completely ordinary concept, that is, it is the “Primary Being”, a Special Life Unit, Giving Origin to all living beings in the World (<i>‘multisoul’</i>);
<br/><br/>
Usually <in layman's thinks>, we often equate the concept of "Entity" with the concept of "Property <of character>" (mean something like 'Essence'), or a complex of certain parameters (of a specific living being). Here, however, we put much more into the concept than can be expressed in words, and then we synthesize several concepts into one, combining them all:
<br/><br/>
<b>{‘God’+‘Soul’+‘Development’+‘Life’+‘World’+‘Truth’}</b>
<br/><br/>
There is also something more that we would like to say, but we cannot, running ahead of the content of research and reasoning, form an erroneous opinion, or, even more so, cause you to have an unpleasant "Hindsight Error" (pseudo phenomenon: "I knew it", or "I already knew it"). Since in the state of cognition, you (together with us) will make a number of discoveries yourselves, which may turn out to be extremely interesting and useful. As a result, your Bright Ideas, born thanks to the knowledge acquired in this audience, will serve humanity in other sciences. However, the main thing that can happen is that you will find the answers to the questions posed (and specifically your questions), since this is what brought you here, and you will learn everything else in the process of research. –So, what awaits us in the end? ... –Eternal Peace;
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
<i>At this stage* of research, it is important to understand the isolated space, which is not limited and includes: The Whole World as a whole - all the conditions of actual infinity that we can imagine, the Universe, and us, and all living beings. But we are also able to understand that we realize only that which we contemplate, which we see "here and now". Everything else, "around the corner", i.e. <b>Everything that we do not see at this moment - <ins>also exist</ins>, but only as a <ins>complex wave function</ins>.</b> If you imagine everything except the function differently - it is worth staying, understanding in more detail, imagining each step in detail, and with the wave and the wave function - you will fully understand later, in the process;</i>
<br/><br/>
Look around again – feel “Consciousness” and this infinite sphere of your space in all directions; Reason consistently, and be sure to be unbiased (like it or not, study all the material for an adequate judgment). If you do not understand – read the research again. We suggest reasoning about “Consciousness” and everything connected with It (<i>‘we hope to dispel the shadow of many doubts’</i>); 
<br/><br/>
* * *
<br/><br/>
* By the end of this book, the attitude to the “subjects” of the research that we are considering here, as well as the attitude to the topic itself, especially to the set Goals, will change beyond recognition for everyone in this audience, because it is impossible to ‘recognize the unfamiliar’, something you have not encountered, but if cognition happens, it will be forever and irreversibly. We will begin to think (reflect) differently, and this is inevitable, therefore, if you do not want to change your attitude to your reality, or consider it threateningly dangerous, do not continue reading – close the book. Or, your mind will transform and form functions that are currently incomprehensible to you, and it will be absolutely impossible (!) to get rid of them after they have already been formed;
